 Because I still don't have the number memorized yet. I think it's 27, but, you know, not 100%. 10. Yep. All right. Thankfully, lore skills are always easier than other skills. Yay. And a 26 is a success. So, according to books found within Ketamari Mander that you had read during some of your downtime, a sensor could be one of a few things. It could be a specialized mind flayer kin. It could be a piece of technology that they employed in the past that creates an illusion of streets that broadcasts to another device that a city watchman could. It could be, like, just kind of like an alarm that goes off if you, you know, break a magical beam of light that goes across the street. Or it could even be something a little bit more nefarious, but they didn't. The last thing was something that you just didn't understand the basis of, but it was. Nefarious and kind of more dangerous than just being spotted. Okay. Then. Like, it could create, like, a magical explosive if you just, like, walked near it. That sucks. Yeah. Cool. Okay. Well, then, I'm guessing I probably... I would think that I wouldn't really impact my stuff since we were only going to be there one night. So I kind of, like, grab my pack, still have my mana blade in my hand ready to go just in case somebody tries to test me. And then I guess I'll go... I assume our rooms are close together, so I'll just go and I'll, like, knock on all the doors and stuff. As you exit into the hallway, you see that each of the doors to everyone else's rooms have all already been opened. And... They... Are people inside waking and rousing the rest of the crew. Very good. Very efficient. Very efficient, yes. And you all kind of get the same spiel. You know, he's... They're a runner from the Smuggler's Caravan, and they're here to take you to the Smuggler's Caravan. And then you guys need to get there in about 20 minutes because they're... They're leaving in 30 minutes. And the person who is there with you is there to guide you past the censors so that you guys, you know, don't alert people. Cool. The person that tried to wake you up, Emily, is a little bit terrified of you. Good. Every time you, like, walk near him, he cringes away. Mm-hmm. And... To be fair, I'm pretty sure the Manablaid is the most expensive piece of equipment he's ever seen in his entire life, but... True. True. True. I believe that the Manablaid counts as an artifact at this point. But that's neither here nor there, and it doesn't matter. So, is there anything special that anyone wants to do on Wake Up with the allotted... With the probably... Not allotted... Not allotted... Not allotted... Not allotted... Not allotted... Not allotted... Yeah, just that one's fun, probably. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure people enjoy all the gritty realism of it. Alrighty. Um, yeah. Afterwards, um... So you guys take ten minutes to wake up. Is that fair to everyone? Ten minutes? Mm-hmm. All right. Yeah, you guys take ten minutes to wake up, and afterwards you guys make your way downstairs where, um... Each of the individuals who woke you guys up, um, all hand you a cloak, and say, we're going to... And the one who woke up, Emily, uh, seems to be the leader of this... Gang. Um, and he's like, so we are going to split you up because it is easier to avoid the sensors, uh, you know, as groups of two than groups of ten. Um, so, uh, just stay close and follow us. Do what we do, not to the exact specifications of what we do, but try to step, you know, near where we step. Duck when we duck. And, uh, if we do this all well, we will get to the hideout without alerting the sensors. Eh? Sound like a fun time? Sure. Excellent. Okay. So, uh, hopefully I will see you all in ten minutes. Um, come little cat, let us be off. Ah, for funsies, can I get a stealth check from everyone? Oh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Shit. Mark it on. It's okay. Okay. Shit. All right. Well. All of you pass your stealth checks. Because you guys are all following the leader. Which I believe gives a big enough bonus that should get everyone through this. We help. So, ten minutes pass. It is, it, it's really weird being in the city at night because all of those things I described except for the, the magical explosive are really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. It's really weird. throughout the city. Um, and you guys have to very weirdly walk through streets. Sometimes you guys, you know, hug up against a wall and walk across it as, you know, you go underneath the, the illusion technology. Um, sometimes you guys, you know, they, they make their way down a street, stop and turn around because, you know, the, the, the, the, the trip wire is there. Um. And sometimes you see them blow dart something up in the sky to just put stuff to sleep for a little bit, the organic sensors. I don't think it's come up, but I really apologize. I can't be a player if I don't say it, but I do have dark vision. Are the organic sensors people? I'm just imagining a Hanar. Yeah, but, like, small. I'm just imagining the little brain things. Intellect devourer? Yeah, that's another, like, it would be like a... subset of an intellect devourer. Yeah, not quite that, but kind of like that. Yeah. Like, yeah, Hanar is a great example, if you guys, from Mass Effect, which are, like, the big, bulbous things with tentacles that, like, have to express, like, verbally what emotion they're feeling. Okay, yeah. They're, like, caution. There's a guy ahead, you know? That's a bad example, but... You know. So. Or, anger. There's a guy ahead. Things like that. Yeah. So, that's what the Hanar look like. So, you know. They could look like that. They could look like some offset of an intellect devourer. They're just some sort of organic mind flayer made from, like, a beast as opposed to a medium humanoid. So, it's not, like, really a mind flayer, but... They can take down War Tools, but it's really like an origami army or something. Yeah. Right? It's more like a time investment. Like, yeah, like, they're able to... Yeah. So, that's really cool starts with some 87 sort of district East but I think, when I officially this aand more private that have working at what could later become the city of power or anything like this, I'm interested in what was the sense of presence, like the West side of thequisition for, like, ... So, TheSQL merchants. Where is this evil December 6th? Or what's the textbooks 1000 words like where this Bush could could be used to longer life desires? Mike, good question. You're on mute? Yeah. You don't have here. I think they're up. To see what that could be. I think they're up. that are being loaded up with boxes of goods. Each of the carts is being led by two horses. And you guys can see drivers for each of the carts. And getting ready talking with their animals and calming them down and getting them ready to go. And as you guys are taking this all in, the leader of the smugglers who you guys bargained with last time, he comes up to you and he goes, you must be... So, welcome to our little smuggling operations. If I... What... Would you guys have given him a false name for your organization or would you guys call yourself the Nightmares? Are we known nowadays? Um... I will say that the Ring City knows the name of the Nightmares, not necessarily you know, random smugglers like this guy. The Ring City definitely knows the name, the Nightmare. So... That is what I will... How I will answer that question. I would err on the side of no. But... Didn't we come up with like a group name? Just us? Yes. I'm going to have to go back through my notes. Not that I was there for it. Um... The what? Dreamcatchers. That's what I was there for. Uh... I thought we had a different name as well, but... I thought it was something ridiculous. I do... Yeah, I thought it was something ridiculous too, but I do remember the Dreamcatchers. I feel like at one point there was a ridiculous name, but then like we came up with like a real, real name. If you ask what do we call ourselves, something... Something ridiculous that I forgot. I mean, I do that sometimes. My character knows, but I don't. Seriously. Yeah, I would say we just introduced ourselves as the Dreamcatchers. Okay. Hello, little Dreamcatchers. Welcome to our little... Why are we always little? I mean, I am, but... Do you have a problem with my height? Aren't you medium-sized? I... You know, I think it just comes down to every time because it sounds good in my head. Do you have a problem with her height? It's because real Joey is tall. It's because real Joey is tall. I think sometimes it is people belittling you, so... Anyways. Hello, Dreamcatchers. Hi. Welcome to my little smuggling operation. Hi. Each of you needs to assign yourself to a cart, and then in about 10 minutes, we'll be good to go. Your job, of course, protect the caravan on the way. We foresee little to no resistance, of course. But, uh, you know, some people are stupid. So, treat them how you think they... Treat them the way you think they deserve to be treated. Should anyone decide to attempt to rob me. You... And should everything go to plan, you will be to Silverleaf in two days in my cousin's warehouse. Okay? What's your cousin's name? My... Cousin's name? Cousin's name? Cousin's name? Cousin's name? Cousin's name? Cousin's name? Cousin's name? Is... Ivan? I am Ivan. You're Ivan, he's Ivan? Yes. Same spelling, or is he like... One is I-van, one is E-van. You know, you gotta check, because sometimes they got the same spelling. That's not what's up, Nico. This joke... This joke comes from a book I read back in middle school, where I was like, are these names... Are they pronounced the same way, or are they not pronounced the same way? Because one's name was literally E-van, and the other one's name was Ivan. Oh. So that is where this joke is coming from. Just because your name sounds familiar, have you ever heard of a man named Da? Who is named Da here? No worries. He's on a... He's on a... Da's on a completely other plane of existence. The other plane of existence? Oh, man. That's just what he wants you to think. Your life is very peculiar to me. Do we know what kind of things we're protecting? Is it anything dangerous, basically? What is dangerous? Like, will it blow up? Explosives. Animals that could maul me if they get out of their cage. Cages. Caustic substances. Poisons. You know, that kind of stuff. Bombs. You won't be mauled by any animals. Okay, but like... Okay, but things might blow up. Got it. So we won't be mauled by anything. We won't be mauled by animals. You won't be mauled by... You won't be mauled by... any animals belonging to me. Yeah, I don't like that. Why don't you like that? Keep adding qualifiers on there. I'm just making sure you understand that you will not be mauled by any animals belonging to me or my smuggling operations during your two-to-three-day trip from Sledgehammer to Silverleaf. Mm-hmm. Yep. That is accurate. It's not very reassuring, but we might as well get going. It's really not. I don't see what the problem is. Eh, we'll figure it out on the day. That day is in about five minutes. Yeah. So, do you have any other questions besides what goods you may or may not be escorting? You know, the less you know, the better for you, really. Was it illegal? I agree. That's why I was just like, is it dangerous? And then you wanted me to define dangerous by giving examples. And then you said, not one example, but the other examples were free games, seemed like. You know, if you get wounded, there is, you know, how you say hazard pay. Oh. If we're wounded by other people, we're wounded for ourselves. Sorry, what was that, Sam? Did we have to be wounded by other people, or can we just be wounded by each other? You, in theory, shouldn't, if you were to be wounded by each other, that is your own fault. Was there a back date on it? No. Okay. Is it illegal? What part of smuggling operations sounds legal to you? Well, like, you know, sometimes you're smuggling food for people who need it for some... What part of smuggling operation is legal to you? I don't know, but he does have legal law. Yeah, honestly... Yeah, you gotta tell me. He really doesn't. That's the cops. You're thinking of cops. The cops gotta tell you. Legally speaking. Actually, technically speaking, the cops do not have to tell you they are cops. That is a false thing spread by cops, that you tell the cops that you're doing the wrong stuff to not cops because you think they're not cops and a way to entrap you. I can confirm that. What he said is true. So if we get stopped by anybody, we should just say, we're definitely not smugglers. I mean, I would not word it that way, but that'd probably be a good idea. Yeah, you know, they're probably looking for smugglers. So if you tell them you're not smugglers, well, who are they going to believe? The evidence of the eyes or the evidence of the ears? You know what I mean? You know what I mean? And, you know, if you come across anyone and they're wondering if you're smugglers and, you know, you think you can get out that way, try it, but you're probably gonna have to hit them really hard. So... To make them understand, right? Of course. I, you know, I can't recommend you do anything illegal. You know, I can't recommend you do anything illegal. So that's why, you know, the smuggling operation, you guys don't know anything about, okay? Smuggling what smuggling? Exactly. Exactly, Mr. Elfman. Mr. Elfman was my father. Mr. Elfman was his grandfather. Yeah. Mr. Elfman was his grandfather. Okay. So, you know, just, you know, get out there, have fun, you know, and I hope to hear from Ivan in two or three days that you guys have arrived safely. Das is good. No, wait, you're not coming with us? I can't have any parts of this. I don't know anything about this. Yeah, he's not a smuggler. Then who do we report to and who's going to pay us? the Ivan will pay you when you arrive and he also knows nothing about this okay what about during the trip I mean you know there's the guys that are you know in charge of the carriage and there's you guys guarding them Jack you got a lot of questions if this is going to be a trap we'll fall into the trap yeah okay we'll figure it out if you want you could roll perception on him you know try to sense motive I would like to do that go for it you feel that while he is being tight lips about what you are escorting he is planning to pay you for escorting this stuff okay good we're not going to get robbed in the middle of this journey he's not secretly a land pirate no no no he is thankful to have guards on this smuggling trip even if you know he doesn't trust you guys and you guys clearly don't trust him but he is you get the feeling he is a man of his word at least for the most part now if you try to fuck him over oh no thieves code he's not going to fuck you over until you fuck him over yeah yeah yeah how does the song how does the song go I don't fuck with ye I don't fuck with you that shit go yeah you know you guys stay on the up and up he'll stay on the up and up alright um our drill front second third or last cart I'll do last cart since I have ranged alright jack front um second third or last cart front zarius front second third or last cart I like the front as well I want to see what's coming right second or third cart uh third third cart Sam by default you are in the second cart just what I wanted excellent I think who's in the car with me no one just the driver just the driver I thought there were three carts we're all budging up there's four there's four carts oh okay there's one of you in each cart except for well there's five there's four carts and five of you okay and Zarius and I are buddies kind of kind of feel like I would be better than you it would be best if I was with was with someone else but that's fine don't you need to like you gotta be able to like talk to everybody right so it's better if you're in the middle I see us running into no issues I'm not helpless on my own but I am brutally diminished but we'll figure it out I can be in the same cart well you're that far away you're just one cart behind us yeah we'll figure it out mmhmm it'll be fine I about a minute like literally a minute after you guys load into the back of the carts they begin to like you guys can hear you guys begin to go down this very large and open tunnel would you guys go down for is it a secret tunnel? it is a secret tunnel you can sing the song secret tunnel secret tunnel through the city don't know if you're going through a mountain you are not going through a mountain you are not going through a mountain you are going through the city through the city I don't know is it like Omashu? is the city also a mountain? the city is not a mountain it is flat flat alright well I tried it's okay you might you know while you're smuggling go through a different secret tunnel that goes under a mountain it's true but the secret tunnel takes you from where you guys are at to the city of Omashu to you know outside of the city so you guys are in this tunnel for two three minutes and eventually you know the it starts to go up an incline which is kind of a little bit murderous on the horses not too murderous but you know these carts you guys can tell because you guys are in the back of the carts that these carts are pretty laden with stuff legitimate business people goods legitimate business people goods correct? yes mhm and so eventually the carts come to a stop and you can hear these like big doors open up and then you know a few seconds later the carts get moving again and you guys get to the top of the cart and you guys get to the top of the cart and you guys get to the top of the cart and you guys get out you guys hear the carts stop again and then you guys can hear those big doors shut and you hear some rustling as they are covered again as the big doors are covered again but you know after that it's it's it's it's it's it's it's as you guys get outside and look around it's it's pretty early in the morning I mean it's it's still night out with how early it is in the morning as you guys were probably aware of um I don't see any more um pentacled purple people you guys are outside of the city um great but didn't we see the pentacled purple person outside the city but like at the queue he was he was he was at the city gates he was like in the water he was like in a watchtower inside the wall yeah he was in a watchtower like by the city gates oh okay yeah and we're not near the city gates now so you guys are probably like half a mile to a mile away from the city right now cool perfect yeah time for fireworks probably be unwise with this smuggling operation that's going on eh that's for them to figure out but yeah um I think the feeling he doesn't understand common what does he speak then I'll try out all my languages what languages you got uh I'll try out is he common how about dwarven um does it just kind of nods and grunts with you when you try speaking in dwarven what about goblin what do you say to a goblin I'm just trying to like I just want to introduce myself you speak common you speak dwarven I gotta grunt you speak goblin he doesn't nod he doesn't grunt but he doesn't you seem to have his attention if he orcas yeah he looks like an orc would somebody say that to him would somebody who doesn't understand the common tongue understand if you said do you speak goblin would they hear the word goblin and understand that he's speaking in goblin when he says that oh who is you I'm a she dude oh sorry forgot she's speaking in goblin when she says that yes I don't actually speak goblin in real life I mean you could speak goblin in real life yeah go to goblin school goblin these people so again he doesn't respond he doesn't like grunt at you but you appear to have his attention when you ask him do you speak goblin okay so I'll just start talking to a goblin then like hey how's it going having a good day where are you from goblin uh he just kind of when you ask are you having a good day he shrugs his shoulder where are you from no response to that hmm okay you can move on I'm just I was just kind of past the time I'm just gonna try and talk with him sounds like there's only one side but you can move on now okay what's everyone else doing I'm just I'm just I'm just I'm just I'm just I'm just I'm just I'm just I'm just I'm just I'm just I'm just I'm just I'm just is there a goblin in my cart are you attempting to interact with this person yes because otherwise I'm going to twiddle my thumbs for the next I mean you're in the same cart as jack be quick I look at jack be quick and then I look to the person does this look like somebody we can talk to um and then I look like do you say that to me or do you say oh no I say it right to you I'm like I'm like Uh, well, I don't know about you, but I'm trying to, like, scope the area. And make sure we don't get, like, ambushed or... We're on guard duty for the caravan, dude. They're gonna be fine. We'll hear it. Other people will scream. I basically give him a look of, like, like, Xerius, get your shit together. Like, stand up in the back. I don't know if the cart's, like, open, if there's a tarp over the top of it, whatever. Yeah, like, if we're tarped, can we even see? I'm gonna, like, get up. I want to be able to, like, look around. 360 view. Uh, yeah, these carts aren't tarped. So they're, like, is it like a cart, as I'm thinking, where, like, in the 1600s, and it's got little... little spokes, and it's a little open flat top? Yeah. Oh, so we're just sitting there. Yeah. With hopefully non-explosives in the back. Or acids. Or poisons. Or acids, or poisons, or other... What do those... What do those goods we're carrying look like? They are in boxes. Are the boxes sealed? Yes. They look like boxes. Does it be, like, in crates, I would guess? Well, like, yeah, but are the crates, like, hammered down? Or is it just, like, a lid? They are certainly hammered down. Yep. If I inspect the box, is there any, like, writing or drawings on the side of it? Like, the skull and crossbones kind of thingy? Roll me perception. Gonna lose ring flick privileges, sure, sir. With a 33... I know. There's... I mean, the only identifying marking on most of these boxes is just the... I know. These boxes is just, like... Is there a skull and crossbones? The name of a... The name of a company. Would I know this company? It is one of the companies from Sledgehammer. So... Oh, okay. It's probably, you know, Ivan's legitimate business front. These are definitely not smuggled goods written on it. Mm-hmm. So it's probably legit. He's just transporting us along with it. Where are the smuggled goods? Can I look to the person who's in the vehicle with us who is not Jack B. Quick? And ask them... The cart driver? Yeah, and ask him what they do. And is this all... Like, is this what they do for a living? Kinda grunts and shrugs his shoulder. Ah, shit. Give me a second. Ah, shit. You do have tongues? Is it prepared? Ah, let me see. You're pretty well prepared to take your clothes off. Um, you're creature willing. Yes, I'm a creature willing. Uh, pretty decent. Um... You seem like you're not interested in plain unusual moh einges, and you just... No. uh, crude, like, mind blown mussel. No, you're pretty good at basic t 음 еngwoge đ MMZUZ I Kaw Okay! that means he doesn't understand me at all. What does he look like? He looks like... Honestly, he's... Let me go look at the ancestries. It's okay. Take it down. No, not archetypes. I want ancestries. Um... Fix this. Um... He looks like an orc. Hey, Jack, be quick. Do you know orcish? No. Fuck. I look back at him. What do you think about... Do you like orcish beer or dwarven beer better? I know. Shrugs your shoulders and grunts at you. Orcish beer is to be feared. Orcish beer is to be feared. But it's good. It's good for the soul. He doesn't say that because he doesn't understand you. I would hope that it would translate across languages. Orcish beer is to be feared. Yes. You know how you can always understand... Most people understand... They know the word of their language in other languages. If somebody is Spanish and says English, I'll understand what they mean. I heard the word English. Orcish beer. And I make the drinking motion. He hands you a canteen? Oh, I'm taking a swig. You're gonna die. I'm 100% taking a swig. Alright. Oh, God. A taste of water. Ah, shit. I hand it back and I go... And I beat my chest and I point to my arms and I'm like... Good. And I make the... I don't know. I'm trying to convey the alcohol. Convey the alcohol. Make a performance check. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I still have some orcish... I still have some beer on me, don't I? I have to. Do you? I always have some beer on me. He has to. Is there even alcohol? He has to. Yes. His PTSD has translated to alcoholism. You know, celebrating alcohol. He is addicted. He's addicted to it now. I don't know. Shit. He's been... I left it on the fucking boat with Oak Snarl. Fuck, dude. Is he on his way? No, we don't know where he is. He's at the druid. We know where he is. No, no. I sent a message. You did not get a message back from Oak Snarl. Not yet. Sent it pretty instantaneously. Sometimes they're busy. Oak Snarl has... He's a busy man, okay? I'm... I'm... I... If... If he responded to your... If he responded to your sending, you would have gotten it immediately. He's a busy tree. No, he just hasn't responded yet. He's a busy tree. Sorry. You can respond within, like, the time you get it. He didn't have time to... To articulate a full response. Yeah. Oak Snarl's not exactly the fastest talker I've ever met. I mean, fuck. Does sending have a limit? Like, um... Uh, 25 words. Yeah, maybe he couldn't do it in 25 words, so he just didn't. All right. Can we try again while we're sitting here? Like, are... Do you want to pantomime drinking beer to this guy, or do you want to use one of your spell slots to cast the sending spell? I just want to pantomime the alcohol. Roll me performance. Ooh. With a 28, you... Do a pretty good impression of someone walking around drunk, and the orc kind of scratches his head, and... And do the canteen again? Ah, damn. Well... How close are the other caravans to us? Um... It's like, can I... Can I talk at a normal volume and they could hear us, or do I have to scream a little? Like, do I shout? I mean, there are horses... Like, horses are loud. But they're just clopping along. Yeah. And the creaking of the wagons. And the creaking of the wagon, and, you know... So, like, I couldn't whisper. I'd have to talk. You'd probably have to raise your... You'd probably have to, you know... Project your voice a little bit. Hmm. But you could potentially talk to another one. I mean, because, you know, there... It's... He's only about 20 feet back behind you. Give or take. Who's in the second? I forgot. Who's in the second? Uh, Sierra is in the second car... Car... Okay. That's me. Are we gonna telephone? No. That would be... We're gonna have a team bonding experience, Arius. Don't worry. You can try. Okay. I guess for now... Arius, he's free to us of you. I'm just gonna, like, twiddle my thumbs, look around, and ask Jack if there's any alcohol. And if not, we should stop and get some soon. No. There is no alcohol. No. We won't be stopping. We're on a job. We'll stop in two days. Right. You guys will probably stop for lunch. Actually, you guys are probably stopping for breakfast. There's no alcohol. Ricky! I bet you there's alcohol. I bet you 10 gold there's alcohol somewhere. We need to have a really serious talk about your alcohol. I haven't drank in, like, a day, okay? I can stop whenever I want. Yeah. It'll be a problem when I run out. Don't encourage Marjorie. I haven't drank in so many hours. Thank you. Listen. Listen. Listen. I don't think you can perform magic drunk as effectively as you can sober. You bet. No. No. That's not a challenge. That's actually definitively not a challenge. Please do not do that. Only because there's no alcohol here will I accept it. Yes. Yes. Big time drinking problem. Then I'm just going to grab my sword, twiddle my thumbs, and talk to my sword. All right. What'd you say to your sword? Ask it how it's doing. Your meat needed to oil the scapper. Was that a yawn? Yeah. My sword yawns? That's cute. It's still asleep. It just barely woke up, man. It's still like slumber. It's like, it's not asleep. It's dozing. Aw. I don't really want to wake it up then. I'm sorry for waking you up. Do you want me to like, do I like pet it to go back to sleep? First swords talk. Now they sleep? So again, he's attempting to awaken his sword. So, sleeping, you know, quotation marks. Like, you are interacting with it to bring it to an awakened state. So you have to keep talking to it. If you stop talking to it, it will go back to a sleeping state. So it's in a dozing state right now. Hey, Jack, be quick. I'm right with you. I did not know it sleep. I mean, I did not know my sword sleeps. I'm going to let it go back to sleep and pet it and oil it a little bit. If you let it go back to sleep. You lose your special magical equipment. Do I have to consistently talk to it forever? You have to talk to it at least once or twice a day. Yeah. Again, I am telling you, you saying the words, letting it go back to sleep means you are no longer talking to it. I don't think that's what he meant. That's what I'm telling you mechanically, what you are telling me. All right. Well, then don't let it go back to sleep. I'm just going to like. Pet it and say it's a good sword and oil it, I guess. Yeah. Oil it good. Okay. Maybe not oil it. We have to make it weird. Yeah. Yeah, we do. Look what party we're in here. True. Well. Joey, do I hear the sword reply? Of course. No. No. Sorry, dog. You haven't talked to the sword enough. I'm just going to be like. You want to talk to my sword too? I'm serious. Why do you keep doing that? Because it talks to me. Again, we need to talk about your alcohol consumption. Bro, if you talk to it. If you're also hearing voices, that's also a concern. I mean, I don't know if it's like a person's voice. I mean, it's like a theory list. That's. It's my friend. You can't take it away from me. I just lost someone. I can't with this. I'm going to take your alcohol away from you. There's no alcohol to take. I look at his canteen. You sure? Whose canteen? The orcs? No, your canteen. My canteen's got water. I was not smart, apparently. I would like to take his canteen. Is he deceiving me, Joey? Do you allow your canteen to be taken, Zarius? Yeah. I mean, it's just water. I take his canteen. I sniff it. It is just water. Good. And it better stay water. Yes, Jack. Be quick. Well, this is fun. Maz. What's he doing, buddy? Maz-y. Yes. Yes. That's me. What's he doing, buddy? Yeah. Um. I actually don't really know. I don't know what I'd be doing here, because I'm mostly just interested in getting to your destination. So you're just chilling in the back of the cart? Yeah, basically. Maybe going back to sleep. I don't really care about, like, what they're transporting or anything like that. Whoa. We're here to get weapons. Maybe try... What's up? Maybe try just trying to go back to sleep. You know, finish up your shut-eye. Uh, the little bit of that ID, yes. Cool. All right. Ardrill. What are you doing? I'm gonna turn around and, like, kind of watch our backs. Make sure, like, nothing's coming from... the back and sides of us. Okay. Cool. All right, yeah. So you guys travel on for... probably, you know, a while. Um. You know, every few hours you guys stop for, like, five minutes to stretch your legs. Um. Uh, and so... You know, after four hours, you guys stop and stretch your legs and you see them get out, you know, cooking equipment and stuff and make breakfast for you guys. Okay. Um. What's your breakfast? You know, bacon and eggs. Some hard bread. What kind of bacon? Is it just orcs? Orc bacon? The bacon kind of bacon. What? It's made of orcs? Bro! We have a cannibalistic orc? Yeah. Pork. No, pork. Oh. Pork? Oh. We all heard orc bacon. Yeah, we all heard orc bacon. Well, that's on you guys. I said... No, I don't think it is. Ah, nah. If more than two of us heard it the other way... No, I wouldn't. Look, that's not all me. You guys are trying to be cannibalistic here. No, it's pork bacon. You know, pig. We are... We're not the ones serving bacon made out of our own people. Again, it's... It's... It's pork. No. Like, pig. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty basic bacon. Mm-hmm. Interesting. What would you expect the bacon to be made out of? I don't know. Is there like a lesser creature? Is a pig not a lesser creature? I don't know if they have pigs, you know? It's a different world. There's orcs. I don't know if pigs exist or is that like insulting to an orc because they're kind of similar. Okay, so let's just say this is a dog. I don't like pigs. But hey, we're calling the orc a pig. Well, if you... Well, I don't think we're cannibalistic. I think it's just not. I don't think it's not. Wow. You're calling the orc a pig? This is racist. No, it's orc-est, but... You get my point. Moving on. We'll be here all night. We're going to be here all night with him. I mean, we did start with a cannibalistic orc. You know, that's... That's... That is a choice you guys made, yeah. I'm sorry. It was my fault. We said it was my fault. I don't know. Yeah. It's my fault we started late. It's a cannibalistic org. It's still my fault we started late. Is your alarm being cannibal? Actual cannibal. Okay. I'm not alone in the woods. I have my cell phone, and it's got power. I don't fear actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf. It's lurking in the shadows. No, I can see pretty far into the shadows from right here. He's not over there. Actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf. Yeah, but you know, just bacon and eggs. Some hard bread. Nothing fancy. That's nothing fancy. Yeah, you guys eat. None of the carriage drivers the car drivers talk to each other. They'll just kind of stare at each other while they're eating. And then after you guys are done eating, they clean up and they're ready to go. Cool. Cool. Y'all good in your same in the same formation? You don't want to switch up cards or anything? I'm good. Unless you're trying to leave me. I mean, it seems like you want to have a conversation. Maybe you enjoy being in a different cart area. I'm sorry. I was just trying to chit chat. No, that's fine. There's nothing wrong with chit chatting. I just, you know, if there's somebody there who wants to chit chat, I'm just trying to, you know, do the job. I don't think any of the orcs speak a different language, unfortunately. Well, I think one is a goblin, so... One is a goblin. Does the goblin speak common? None of them speak the same language. Well, then, there you go. Sierra's looking for someone to talk to. Well, I'm not. Okay. Okay! Alright. Well, after, you know, breakfast, it mostly continues kind of the same way. Like, you know, every two, two, two, three hours, you guys stop your legs for five minutes. Noon, you guys break for, you know, around noon, you guys break for lunch. They prep some, you know, salted meats with some, you know, cheese. They pass that out for you guys to eat. They give you, again, some hard bread. Nice. Again, it's not the best food you've ever eaten, but, you know, it's... It's food. It's free. Yeah. You know, you guys keep going again. The sun begins to set. And... And I get perception checks from Ardrill and Emily. Well... Wasn't that perceptive? Well, the sun is beginning to set, Emily. So in the direction... You're looking west, and the sun is just in your eye. And you can't see it. You know, it's like trying to drive down Hull Street when the sun's trying to set in the winter. And you just can't see any of the fucking lights. And you're just like, this is ridiculous. Why did they remove the trees for, you know, that little bit of shade from the center of the road? I don't feel you. Who put the sun there kind of thing? It's... It's really bad trying to drive down Hull Street if you're heading west when the sun is setting. Because it is, like, literally right... If you hit it at the wrong time, the sun is literally right behind the fucking streetlights. Um... So you don't... You don't spot anything. But Ardrill, you're looking... You are looking east. And you spot, um... some... Uh... What look to me riders bearing down on you guys. What are they riding? What would you like them to be riding, Sam? Beetles. They are riding beetles. Fuck yes. Do the beetles fly? Uh, they are. They are hovering off the ground. Okay. They're hovering? How far away are they? Uh, they will be upon you probably in the next 30 seconds to a minute. Okay. I, uh... Can I tap the driver on the shoulder and point? The driver who's in the back? No, I mean, like, I turn around and, like, tap him on the shoulder and point. I mean, he's in the back, so he just kind of starts, you know, yelling in his tongue. And also yell that we have visitors. As you hear from the back... Well, actually, probably all of you guys hear from the back from Ardrill, you guys got visitors. Uh, bug riders. Bug riders. Bug riders. That's cool. Do they look scary? They're riding bugs. Four of them appear to be... Uh, roll me perception check. Other than riding bugs, you can't tell much about them. Want to know more roll perception? Uh, with, uh... With those... Emily, you're still a little bit blinded from looking straight into the sun. Bug. Xerius, you're... You're feeling the... You're feeling the effects of not having a drop of alcohol for probably... the past... Cosmath, a... uh... the past 14 hours, so you're a little bit... Can I actually make the first one my hunted prey? You can, um... Whoa! Uh, yeah, I think so. Um, I need to decide which is the front one. Uh, give me one second. You want it to be the red one, right? Right. As your... As your hunted prey? Sure. I don't know, he said the red one. He's already colored them. Wait, wait, we're still on the other screen, Joey, just in case. Oh, I know. Yeah, we're not with you. There's nothing to see on this screen yet. Oh, okay, good. Yeah. There's no enemies because... Well, you said the red one, and we were like, what's the red one? Sure, the red one. The red one's in front. The red one is typically the first one that I mark because it's the first color. Uh, right there with you, Joey. I knew what you meant when you said the red one. I don't know if... It makes a difference, but I get a plus two. If I... If you do let me make it my hunted prey, I get a plus two bonus. That still does not help you perceive bugs. Who said we're fighting them? They might be nice people on bugs. I mean, you know, you can attempt to believe that. I can. We're also not right there. We are being smuggled right now by orcs. And goblins. And... I feel like this is their problem. Not ours. And... Until it becomes our problem. Back it up. You know, an orc, a goblin, a gnome, and a... What's a fun one here? And a tengu. Ooh. Aw. Yeah. See, that was everything. I haven't heard that word since I last played Yu-Gi-Oh. How long ago was that? That was probably a while. It was back when Synchro first became a thing. Mm-hmm. Reborn tengu. Alrighty. Let me write down. So we got an orc. Goblin. Gnome. Tengu. Tengu. These are the carriage drivers. Okay. So. So. Yeah, Argyle, you're feeling the withdrawal effects of not having to drop the alcohol for 14 hours. Jack, you're still blinded from the sun being in your eyes. Argyle, it's rocky and you're having trouble making out what you're seeing. Is anyone else rolling perception checks to figure out what at least these guys might be wearing or, you know, try to identify them a little bit? Can I go warfare? Warfare? Warfare. Warfare. Warfare. Warfare. Warfare. Warfare. Warfare. Warfare. Warfare. Warfare. Warfare. Check. Sure. I think. Um. Bearing in mind that I have a shit ton of class features that allow me to do exactly that shit. I will trust you and say, yeah, you can probably use warfare or lore. 36. Um. The person in front appears to have a big ass hammer on their back and they're wearing. Um. Some sort of light armor. Ooh. I guess. I got one other question. What's up? Can I look at the orc, point at the people, and then, like, unsheath my rapier, and then sheath my rapier, and, like, get them, you know, like, should I be, like, getting my sword out kind of thing? Yeah. They're the ones leading us, right? Who's the leader of this little band of... Their job is to get from point A to point B as fast as possible. Your job is to stop the people who are bearing down on you from getting to the carts. So then the orc is saying, sword out, point at them. The orc's not saying anything. He's getting ready to go faster. So we're on the vehicles. Yeah. Moving along. Okay. Yeah. Moving right along. But these guys, because they're not laid in down with supplies, you're going faster than you, so someone's going to have to stop and intercept them. Gotcha. What's to keep them from, like, keep going? You. I mean, they could just go around us. Like, if we jump off the carts. I mean... To stop them. Yeah, that's a possibility. Yeah. Argyle, you got the range. Yeah, but Hutzpah. I mean, we could also just have mounted combat. That is a possibility. Did I roll my initiative? You're a warfare lord? Oh, sorry. I didn't know you wanted me to. Yes, I can do that. Ian, that was a good word. I appreciate it. What particular thing were you looking for? I don't know why I did anything. I don't know what... I was totally zonked out. Sorry, it's late. I'm just a little, like, can I get, like, a general idea of, like, what they're wearing, what kind of weapons they've got? So, yeah, with a 24, because lore is always easier. Again, the person in front, who's the person you have the best view of right now, has a big hammer on their back. They're wearing light armor. And... It, you know... These beetles don't look like, you know, the most maneuverable thing, so... They're just fast. They're good at going in straight lines. I will give you that. You're making beetles, by the way. What? Thank you for making them beetles. It's fucking cool. It affects me 0% what they're riding on. Still fucking cool. They're beetles. They're cool. So, again, you can kind of get a feeling that by... These beetles are great at going in straight lines, but turning is not their forte. So... I can't imagine that turnings really are a forte with heavily laden carts. Yeah, but, you know, you're better, probably slightly better at turning than they are. If only ever so slightly. So... So... There is a good chance that if you guys... Intercept them not on the carts, the carts can keep going, and they'll have to deal with you because you can just interrupt the beetles. So... If you guys don't want to do cart combat. We can just step off the carts. We are the... We are the wall. What do they want, anyway? They don't want to be our staff. Never mind. I don't care. Depression. Depression. I gotta add something about Maz and his depression. Okay. So. Ardril, I will say they are... Probably at this point, they are a good 20 seconds away. What do you... What are you doing? You're the one who's got the best eyes on them. Actually, everyone's got good eyes on them. Are you... You're... I'm going to say you're in charge right now. Are they in range? 15 seconds. They are... I mean, they are with... They are not within your first range increment. Okay. I will say... What's your range increment? 100 feet? I don't... I think it matters if I do... I don't know. Is that they're about... They're about... Yeah. So, 15 seconds. They're about two and a half turns away right now. So, we'll say... We'll say... We'll say... We'll say... We'll say... We'll say... We'll say... They're... Let me do some quick maths. They're probably about... They're probably about 400 feet away from you right now. So, they might actually be... I don't actually know. You have a Longbow. What's the Longbow's range increment? I think it's only 100 feet. So, they might actually be right on the cusp of your fourth range increment. Yeah. So, they're on your fourth range increment. So, you would take a minus eight to attack them right now. Yeah. Assuming you don't have something because of, like, Hunted Prey or things like that. Yeah. I've got something, but I can't find it. I can't find it. Let me look in our console. Hunter's Edge. Your Precision, yes? Let's see. I can tell you that your Precision Hunt Edge gives you Precision damage against a person you strike on your first attack. The first time you hit them in a round. If you have a feat, I don't know after that. That's what I'm trying to look. I thought I did, but I don't think I do. Because that doesn't... Oh, yeah. It's part of Hunt Prey. You also ignore the penalty for making range attacks in your second range increment against the prey you're hunting. Okay. That's what I thought. Yeah. And they're within your fourth range increment. Nice. So. It's going to be a minus eight penalty if you want to try to attack right now. I mean, I might as well. Okay. Yeah. It's not like we track arrows or anything. See if there's any... I'm going to do Hunter's Aim on him. Okay. Which gives me a plus two. Okay. So, it'll be... Whatever I roll, minus six. Okay. Let's see. 17. 18. Oh. Ow. That misses. Actually, no. That was the wrong... That's the... Well, that says it's also your second attack. Yeah. Yeah. I rolled the wrong one. Sorry. So, we can add five to that. That brings it up to a 20. You still miss with a... 29 minus six. 29 minus... Actually, 29 minus six hits. Okay. And then... So, you'll deal 14 damage to the front one. Okay. And then... I will... Is there anybody else ranged? In our group? Legally, Maz is ranged. Yes. I can make you be ranged twice. Legally. I will give... I will give... Uh... Maz, Warden's Boon. What's that do? So, to the end of your next turn, you also have hunted prey. Could you briefly detail for me, like... The only thing it would really affect is the range increment thing. He makes spell attacks, so it probably doesn't help him. Okay. All righty. Um... Do you want to make another pop shot at them? Because we'll say that was your one turn, because I don't think anyone else can really affect them at this distance. Yeah, sure. Actually, I'm going to cast Gravity Weapon. Might as well. Okay. Does anyone else cast any other buffs while you guys... Because you guys have a round... I can have him make another attack. Can I? Oh, you are not within range of him. I'm not within 30 feet? He... Well, each card's about 20 feet away from each other, and he's in the last card, and you're in the second one. So, he's about 40... He's about... Yeah, he's much more than 30 feet away from you. Are these... Are these... Are these bad guys more than 500 feet away from us? They are... They are now about... One second. Because I'll use something on them when they get within 500 feet. They're within 500 feet of you. How easy would it be to fireball someone over there? You would cast Fireball and throw it over there? Then that's exactly what I want to do. Fuck them. Okay. Hell yeah. Throw a Fireball. Uh... Uh... Hello? Sorry, it's a 20-foot bird. It did not set off right. Give me a second. I got real quiet. No, you're good. I'm seeing why it's not. Does the damage even happen? Yeah. It's... It's... That. There you go. But you're level 10, so you have 4th and 5th level spell slots. So did you want to cast that at 4th level or 5th level? I was casting... I think I have, what? How many 5th level spots? Two. Yeah, we're going to use it at 5th level. But you also... Did you use one for sending? No, you didn't say you were doing that. No. That was a whole day ago. I have slept... Since then. That was the other day. So we're actually rolling... I think it's... Let me look. It's like 10v6. It's 10v6. Okay, there we go. Why is this here? No, you... This can't crit. Oh, check. Crit. Alright. That was quick math in head. That was a lot of fucking damage. How close they all are to each other. That actually... It's going to hit all of them. It has a 40... It's a 20-foot burst, which is... And they're bugs. They're weak to fire type. That could be true. Yeah, it's a 20-foot burst, so it's... No, that's not... That doesn't help you. It's a 20-foot burst, so it's like covering that much area. Straight up and down. Nah, don't, don't, don't, don't. No diagonal. What are you talking about? Yeah, it... Trust me, it's hitting all of them. Alright. Well, fuck them. Okay. Okay, gotta do... Reflex saves. One, two, three, four. Five. Okay. So, one of them is gonna take... One of them gets hit by the fireball, and you can tell their beetle is fuckucked up, and they are limping along at this point. So he's no factor if we keep moving, got it. I mean... Yeah, but he will... Just because he's going at, like, half the speed of the other guys doesn't mean he's not gonna still be here next turn. He's just not gonna... But it hits their beetles too, though, right? So it hits their beetles. Oh, yeah, it does, yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. And I assume the beetles take the full front of that damage. Yeah, I'm not... I was about to say, I doubt the beetles have a good saving throw. They probably don't. All the other ones, though, do save. So they are going to take half of that while that person gets fuckucked up by it. Okay. So, blah, blah, blah. So that person, okay. So, 15, 16, 17... 18 times... There's four or five of them. There are five of them. So 18 times four... Let's see... Are you trying to figure out how much damage you did this round? I can tell you I did 109 damage. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Almost. Yes. Depending on how you halved it. Always round down, friendo. So, 16 or 18 damage. It'd be 18 to each of them, yes. So, yeah. So, 109 damage. Plus damage to their mounts. Again, all of their mounts are very hurt, but they're all going to be here... They're all still going to be here next turn. Oh, excellent. Wait. One second. Oh, funny. Okay. Does anybody else want to do anything to these guys before they get here? I mean, if I have another turn, I'll throw another fireball. Fuck them. I'm going to cast Gravity Weapon and shoot at them again. Okay. Okay. Which one are you shooting at? Same one. Okay. So, fuck. They're moving. So, they're 400 feet away. So, minus 150 brings us down to... So, they're 250s. So, they're within the third range increment. So, minus six again. Minus six. So, down to a minus four. 32. Okay. So, 12 damage. Plus four. That's a Gravity Weapon. That's four from Gravity Weapon. All right. And they are officially within range of you guys. Yes. The green one, Eidol, like, dies as they get to right there. And they hide. They hop off. And then everyone else goes a little bit further. And their beetle then dies. And they hop off of it. Well, I feel bad for their beetles. Well, you're the one who threw a fireball at them. Xerius. Xerius, can I get Arcane Initiative from you? Daniel, can I get... Can I get... Uh... Uh... Your highest... Let's go with... Daniel, let's go... Actually, yeah, Daniel, let's go with Perception Initiative from you. And then Perception Initiative from everyone else as well. Is that fair? Lore Initiative from me. If you've got a feat that says that, go for it. I don't. It's a class feature, actually. That sounds like a feat to me. Is it considered a... Like a Perception check? What do you mean? So, I get plus two against my 100 prey. Perception checks. No, you're rolling Initiative. Okay. I didn't realize... I didn't know if it... counted it as a Perception check. No, it's not a... No, this is not a Perception check. Like... Fucking poopy. That's fine. Most of us, at least. Where does it say I get to do that? I don't know. Level three. I can use Warfare Lore for my Initiative roll. Who? As long as I'm observing an enemy. I'm also going to use my Gunslinger talent to get a plus two to this check. Okay. Slinger's Readiness. I'm going to use ten paces. Okay. I get a plus two bonus to my Initiative roll, and I can interact and draw one one-handed firearm or one one-handed crossbow. So, my first action, my first attack, and I step up to ten paces of free action. I think I'm not going to do that, though. I roll it. I'm working on it. Give me a break. I've got so many buttons. Why did his picture not show up? Weird. Weird. Let me choose Warfare Lore for my check. So, I'm just going to do Thievery because it's the same number, 21. Okay. Does that work? That's fine. Two to that. So, 35. Sam, what is your wisdom? Zero. All right. That is the order. Oz, you're up first. All right. We're going to do... Next action is to cast... I haven't used some of this shit in so long. That's why we're doing this combat. So, I can't change Chain Lingering and Fortissimo, which is fine. Okay. We're going to use Fortissimo, which... I don't... Oh, let's see. Is this in my actual character sheet? Pop that out. Move it here. Spells. Focus spells. Yeah, it is. Okay. Performance check against high school DC. The composition is targets. Because this is going to be for the Courageous Anthem. So, 64 emanation. Okay. So, I guess... So, you're doing Courageous Anthem. Yeah. So, I guess currently the only target is... It's emanation. So, I guess the only target is me. Yeah. Well, it's 60 feet, right? Yeah. Okay. So, Sam, what is your will DC? I mean, my... It's zero. My ship is zero. My modifier is zero. Your will DC. Oh, 15. 25 plus 5 to 10. So, I... Fuck me. Holy shit. Are you sure what your will DC? So, it's... Sorry. 10 plus my will save? Yep. So, 25? Yeah. And, Ian, what's your will DC? 20. So, it's going to be 25. That is your... 29 is higher than 25. Okay. So, now everybody gets plus 3 to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves. And it's plus 2 because you only succeeded. You're right. Plus 2. For one round. And then... I think that what I'm actually going to do is... We're going to try... Something that I kind of fucked around with. That I still need to add to my character sheet. But we're going to... By the way, you've used one action so far. Correct. I'm going to... Use cast electric arc. Okay. On this guy. Which I actually guess I don't have. And who's the other person you're hitting with electric arc? We're going to go with blue. So, orange and blue. Okay. I don't think I have this imported into this yet. So, to spell attack roll. Okay. Which means that what we're going to do... It is to spell attack roll, right? I'm checking. Sorry, new keyboard. With basic reflex save. Sorry. They each have a basic reflex save. Oh, basic reflex save? Okay. Yes. And you're attacking... Orange. Orange and blue. Yes. Okay. 33 and 26. One of those succeeds. The other one does not. Okay. Which, right now, if I understand correctly... Orange. Orange had the 26. Okay. Okay. So, as from what I understand, that should be 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. 64. Let's see. 2D4. And then you're casting a 5th level spell. So that adds 4D4. So 64, which is what you rolled, correct? And then 15 damage to one and 7 damage to the other. And I shoot my turn. Okay. Okay. Sierra, it's your turn. Yay. None of my friends are quite in range for me to do anything. All right. That's okay, though. We can improvise. Improvise, adapt, and overcome. You could also get out of the back of the cart and, you know, run up on your front. Wait, are the carts rolling? Yeah, but I'm Jack's melee, so he's got to... Yeah, I got to get off the cart. Yeah. And Xerius' melee. Yeah. I'm going to get off the cart. I'm going to get off the cart. I'm going to get off the cart. I'm going to get off the cart. I'm going to get off the cart. I'm going to get off the cart. So he's got to get off the cart. Only if I don't fireball them first, I wouldn't get too close. But just you wait. I'm going to catch up. Oh, well, I thought we were... Okay. Well... Again, all of their beetles just died, so they're going to keep pursuing you guys. They're much slower on foot, I would... Yeah. I mean, you guys aren't exactly going super fast, so, you know... What happened here? Something's wrong. They can't run to catch up. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. What's your health speeds? Whatever the cart's going. I don't know. Probably 30. I think everyone's 30. You're not 30? 35. But also, I have warp step, which I can go a little bit faster. Why am I 35? Because you have elite and you have elf as a base. And you have health and speed. There. Oh, I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. There it is. There it is. And then 아니라 Duel Elf. As my first action on my first turn, I'm going to move 10 feet. I'm going to do a little dodge roll over here. OK. Then I'm going to use Gather to me. OK. So, I signal my team to move position. Signal all squad mates. Every single person can use the stride action as a reaction. But you must enter the movement inside my banner's aura or as close to my banner's aura as the movement speed allows. allows. Everyone. If you want to move, you can. But you must end in the aura or close to the aura. Can you give yourself an aura so that we might know where the aura is? Not visible to us. Give me a second. We would like to see the aura. Okay, so we can stride as long as we end in the aura or as close to it as possible. You two are already inside the aura, so as long as you don't leave the aura, you're fine. So we are stopping to fight them. Yeah, they'll keep pursuing you guys. Your job is to kill people attacking the caravan. Sorry, he didn't say kill. You know. Who are waiting for me? Does anyone use reactions? Me! I'll give Jack a bonus. But it's okay, I have extra now. I'm giving you another reaction. I have tactical reflexes. Yeah, but I'm giving you another reaction. At the start of each turn, when I regain my actions, I gain an additional reaction that can only be used to do a reactive strike. So I can do... So I can use this as a reaction and then I still have two reactions? One of which has to. It can only be used for a reactive strike. Which actually works out really well. Are we doing the weird, like, half... Half... Half movement on the diagonal? That's so much effort. Okay. So I can move six blocks. One, two... Arjun, are you moving? Will the wagon actually move? No, the wagon's not gonna move. They're just addressing. I mean, they are moving, but they're not gonna clear the map by the time you guys are done with them. Probably. Actually... Um... Darius, are you gonna move? Can I, like, take cover behind? You have to move closer to the aura. I would, like, stand here if I were you, Jack, be quick. But I'll come. Wait, how far? Emily, you should probably stand over here. I should stand over here? Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine. So that way you can just fireball. Yeah, I'm straight gonna fireball these people once more. Okay. When I get my turn, I am just gonna hope I do another 100 damage and call it a day. Do you have a spell that is a... Oh, yeah. Fuck it. All right, we're gonna do slip and sizzle. Whoa, slow down, slow down. So you moved as one action. I moved. I moved as a free action. Oh, okay, okay, okay. With 10 paces. Okay, and then you activated this, and then you gave a reaction, and so you still, and slip and sizzle, you just one action, too? I have two actions. No, drilled reactions is whenever I give someone an order, I can just give them a reaction. It's so I don't eat people's reactions. Okay. Okay. It's called drilled reactions. Once per round, when you use a tactic, you can grant one ally of your choice an extra reaction for that tactic, and you lost if it's not. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna use slip and sizzle. So I'm gonna tell Jack to try and trip the target. So my team executes a brutal takedown. I'm just gonna copy and paste it, y'all. There we go. Do you have it yet? I'm gonna tab over. I'm gonna tab over. Wait, no, I can't do that, because Zari's already used his reaction. Never mind. Please disregard. Save that for next turn. Oh, okay. Sorry. Zari, so you need to get one step, you need to get one step closer? No. I'm perfect where I am. Hmm? He wants to be away to do ranged damage. Zarius? Yes. Why'd you get closer? I didn't. Right here. Because I only have one more fireball. So you can get closer, but not too much closer. Yeah, I'll assume I won't kill them with the fireball, but I'll weaken them, so then we'll kill them after. Do you want me to give you a step as a free action? Uh... No, because I don't... I don't need it. Okay. I'll only... I'll use the fireball, and then I'll probably step up after and let them step to me. There are... It doesn't look like they have any ranged weapons, right? Uh... You got... The people... The red... The red person in the front has a big hammer on their back, and it looks to be wearing some sort of plate armor. The other person you've done any research on... You can roll a perception check to look at... Oh, I guess the rest of them also have hammers. The guy... This other person in the back, you don't have a good angle on, so you can't really tell what he's doing. Okay. In that case, I'm just going to keep it simple. I'm going to faint. I'm going to faint red one. Crit failed, because I'm great at this game. Well, you can't faint that person anyways. Not... You have to be with a melee reachable of the target you attempt to faint. You speak wisdom. You speak wisdom, Johnny. Beyond your years, you know that? Yeah, it's... Yeah, yeah. It's... I... I... Tornad thing that make my taunt ranged. I think it's a swashbuckler thing that I always think it is. Oh, well. I was going to use my banner thing to give us all DR. Okay. Are you planting the flag? No. I can't plant the flag if I use any of my brandish tactics. Okay. And I'm going to move over here, I think, to just keep everyone more comfortably in my aura to allow more freedom. I'm sorry. That's your fourth action? Third. Okay. So your first action was to... Ten paces. Not an action. Then I used Gather to... You used Gather to me. That's one action. Uh-huh. Then I used Defiant Banner, and then I moved. I feel like you used another action in there. Okay. I tried to faint, but you said I couldn't, so... I'll trust you that you did not use another action. Well, I tried to faint. No, you did a lot of stuff on your turn, Sam, and I don't know what your character does. Fair. So I'm trying to parse... through it. All right. So I used ten steps, ten paces, went on my first for free action. Yep, you should have linked that one. Hmm? Sammy, please link your powers when you use them. So I know what's going on. We can all learn. You don't have to. You don't have to do it right now. I trust you. Just in the future, please link all of your powers when you use them. Free action. Yep. I believe it was a free action. I trust you on that. I trust that you have used the proper number of actions. Just in the future, going forward, please link your powers. You do not need to link them all right now. I'm trying to... I need to link the last one. It's Defiant Banner. It's how much DR everyone gets. My intelligence modifier is five, so everyone has resistance five against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. And that's my turn. Okay. The guy in the back's turn. Let's see. Okay, he is going to go... He's going to go to here. And he's going to swing on you, Emily. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. He misses his attack. Good. And he will honestly try again. 27 versus your AC. I'm trying to remember. You haven't activated that? Yeah, that's what I was thinking. You haven't had a turn yet, so you haven't. Yeah, then it beats. Sam, do you give out reactions? Yes. Okay, so the only person who actually could have moved when you did your big move power was Moz. Gotcha. Yeah. Because no one else had any reactions. Enough to remember for next time. Why? So you don't gain a reaction until you get your first turn. Unless you're a guardian. Unless you're a guardian. So technically the only people that could have moved were you and Emily because she gave Emily I corrected myself. Yes, sorry. She gave Emily a reaction to move. Stuff to remember for next time. We're all learning together. Yeah, because then Dudo smacked me and I can't even smack back. Rude. Uh, 27 versus AC. No hits. 13 piercing damage. That is his turn. Ardor, it's your turn. Reduced by 5 down to 8, right? Reduced by 5 down to 8. That's how the power works. I give everyone resistance to piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing. Equal to my intelligence modifier. That was piercing damage. Down to 8. Got it. I've already done that. I need to put this on here. Okay, my turn. I'm going to... I'm going to make a spreadsheet for my character. I'm going to do Hunter's Aim on the red guy. Okay. So that's a plus 2. Okay. Okay. So 42. 42 is a crit. Damn. Oh, and also... Let me make sure. You have precision, right? So I believe that adds... precision damage on top of that, yes? Yes. Let me just roll it. Okay. And then I have a new... I've got to look at my new things. Oh, don't forget to add your precision damage. Where does that go? You would... It's whatever... your precision damage is, and then we'll double it. I think it's a D8. Oh, yeah. Because of the... Because that's your hunted target. And that's your... That's your thing. I can't type. That's okay. ... I have the Slashes before the R as well. Alright. So... Oh, that's right. You have... You have deadly, so... I don't know what. do do do do that's sort of this okay and then emily i think emily can do that too all righty um you took that guy from not hurt to fucked up okay no that doesn't matter it only affects me so i took the sniper do okay it's two okay and i'm going to take an assisting shot okay and that's my second oh oh and you have the plus two to this one as well plus two yes okay that's also a crit uh that person is dead just because i want to yeah no they're they're super dead they weren't dead before they're even more dead now yeah that person is riddled with arrows um thanks for giving me that you're giving me at a planking position appreciate it oh yeah that's my turn but that that person stepped into the wrong area well that person so that person's gonna go there hey bro you can totally tank these hits if i drop the fireball on us you got this person is going to go here because i'm straight up about to block that i'm about to drop it on us i don't really care person's going here yeah i'm dropping that shit here i'm dropping that shit here i'm dropping that shit here i'm dropping that shit here i'm dropping that shit here i'm dropping it right on us do you want me to extricate us call me quirky sam uh this person runs up on you and takes their hammer and swings down at your leg orangey uh orangey yeah how is she gonna hit my legs when she's on top of a beetle they all all the beetles died and they jumped off oh oh I murdered him. They all got fireballed. 33 versus your AC. You take 17 damage. I take 12, thank you. You are knocked prone. You are clumsy one for one minute. And you take a minus five foot penalty to your speed. And you now have weakness five to all of that person strikes for the next minute. That's it. There's no more? No, that takes two actions. Emily, Blue is going to attempt to hit you in your legs. Okay. 24 versus AC. And you are flunked by Blue. Meats. Meats? So you're going to take 16 damage. You are also less because of Sam. You are also knocked prone. And you are clumsy one for one minute. And as long as this clumsy condition lasts, you take a minus five minus five to your speed. And you have weakness five to this character's strikes. I've done weird things. Sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I meant to hit the plus button to like add my That's a-okay. Okay. Because you are prone, Green is going to rain hammers down on your head. They're going to swing on you twice. 24. We have established that hits. You will take another 11 bludgeoning damage. Said Green? Just by five. And then they will miss. Is she off guard to Green? She is prone now. Because Blue ran up and knocked them in the lane. And she's got her leg really hard. Yes, she's prone. So she is prone. I'm clumsy. I'm what? Clumsy one. You are currently prone. And you take a minus five penalty to your speed until your clumsy wears off, which will wear off in a minute. And you also have weakness to Blue's attacks equal to five. That is all of their turns. Jack, it's your turn. You are prone. Yes. We have only one attempt to win a match. And, as a result, we defeated them. So, the third technique you'll be doing is sort of no village. And so it's going to beiono a bit animations. Daleks have been able quite a bit weak 5 to that, but you resist 5 of that, so it's 14 damage. And the other one is 11 damage. But you have resistance to 5 of that damage. Okay, but I'm standing, so I'm no longer... You're standing. Woo! And just as an FYI, unless you change the crystal without telling me, your mana blade has been established to be on fire. Yes. Yes. You did it. On fire. Alright, I am going to... Do I activate dueling pair? Or that's just like, I have it in my hand. Does dueling... That is an action you take. Unless you have their influence, you're 20. I'm talking about the stance, in which case you still also have to activate it. I'm pretty sure what's going to happen is I'm going to slam down. Oh. That's two actions. I already used an action. Alright, I guess I am... I will point out orange is hurt. Just as an FYI. Yeah, bitch. I don't want to switch to ranged. I'm going to be the blue-green-er, the guy behind. Behind you. There's so many people. Zarius, you're going to explode a fireball, right? That's the plan. Probably hit green, blue, and orange, right? Without hitting us? Alright, I'm going to try to slam down on this friend. Sorry. Missed. The one person not colored. Cool. Yes. The one person not colored. Okay. I'm going to make my attack... I doubt that hits. 24 hits. Oh. Shocking. There's no beneficial bubble. Do I roll for damage first, or do I... That doesn't make any sense. You roll for damage first. There's no beneficial bubble. It's not beneficial? You're going to roll for damage first, or do I... That doesn't make any sense. You roll for damage first. There's no beneficial bubble. I'm going to... Okay. She rolls to full damage. Ooh! SecondOSH. SecondSHeepoto. Uh... Sean! Second Felix 교체 Oh, you... Sorry. Not Kamen Rider ? No. ShadyGhost ShadyGhost ShadyGhost It's change! What happened to the system? It... There goes the Leech tiles. He can use that, nevermind. considered an attack? The slamdown, yeah. The slamdown is an attack. She did attack. Oh, the athletics, I think, is what he's talking about. But my attack didn't be an attack. Oh, it is? Oh, okay. That's the attack trait. That's not the one I want. That's not the one I want. It's the one from before. That's the one I want. Yeah. But tripping is not a strike. It's just an attack, right? I said it was an attack. I was not asked if it was a strike. Well, the reason I'm asking, I just linked it. You take advantage of your spotter's devastating attack. Your spotter critically sees that as a strike. They didn't really see that as a strike. Emily, roll me a d6. Okay. Oh, where's my... I can't use that one. Never mind, I can't use this one. You do an extra five. I think I can sell such a nice black coin... s**t Alright, I believe that's Emily's turn Yes Zarius You're gonna activate the ring of fire I don't think that was correct Alright, could you please put on the map Where you would like this ring of fire to hit So I know who to tell to roll So you're not hitting orange No, we're hitting orange You are hitting orange Yeah, we're hitting all of us Fuck, that was not a lot of damage, dude That was a fucking shitty roll They could all roll ones, man Doesn't matter So you start at the corner of the square You start at the corner of any square And then you do 20 feet in every direction from that square Alright Me and Emily gotta roll against this, too Yeah Okay, we're doing Roll a D, reflex DC I'm reflexing Oof Yep I can roll a one Can I use my Dude Can I use my hero point? I wanna use my hero point Yeah, I wanna use my hero point, too You just gotta declare that you're using them Emily, you Fuck me, man Well, thankfully You We do use the fire roll when you use hero points You did get a 20 Yeah, yeah, yeah But it wasn't enough Alrighty 25 So Um Blue Succeeded Green succeeded Orange failed again Um And The A mystery man up top also succeeded They didn't roll ones, did they, Joey? I said they could roll ones I didn't say they would roll ones In fact, you guys are the ones who rolled ones Dude, that's true Fucking jinxed us right there This person Catches on fire and crumbles into ash I can take it I mean, maybe Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Um Oh, that does actually trigger Orange's reactive strike Before you roll the attack Just as an FYI Um If they get a crit It's not going to interrupt the attack As I already said, it went through Just as an FYI But they do get to strike you Um Um Uh, they're going to hit you for 38 damage. Do I get, like, a... DR5. 33. They did crit you, but I already said it went through, so it's not interrupting your spellcast. How much did you say? Uh, 38 minus 5. So, 33? Yes. Yes. Blue already used their reaction, or they would be smacking you, too. That was a tough hit, man. Yeah, you're the one who chose not to step back. Well, I would have taken two hits, so... Yeah, but no, stepping doesn't trigger reactions. And you would have avoided your own fireball. Okay. Okay. Alright, you have one action left. I'm going to swing at the blue person with my rapier. Okay. You also cast a spell. Did you want to go into Arcane Cascade? Yeah. Well, Arcane Cascade, doesn't it cost two? No, it costs one action to go into Arcane Cascade. And the spell's only one. You're right. Okay. Yeah, we'll Arcane Cascade them. Okay. We're doing blue person. No, but you're not spellstriking, you're activating Arcane Cascade. Oh, yeah, afterwards. Well... No, because... I want to spellstrike Arcane Cascade recharge. I wouldn't want to use it for... No, we always get that backwards. Our casting Arcane Cascade does not recharge your spellstrike. We always do that wrong. Yeah, it's activating your focus spell that recharges it. Hmm. I thought... That's just... Okay, I guess we did that wrong. I explained it to you wrong. That happened. Okay, yeah, then I go into Arcane Cascade afterwards. Okay, cool. That brings us back to Mars. Yeah. Wait, did that one hit? No. Linger, Lime... If you're activating Arcane Cascade, you're not stringing with your weight rapier. That's not cool. It's one or the other? It's one or the other. You used two actions to cast Fireball. Oh, then I was going to hit the... Oh, yeah, I guess I'm going to spellstrike next turn. That's fair. Oh, I guess I can't do everything I want to do. Is one of the things you want to... There we go. Sorry, go ahead. One of the things I want to do is move, in fact. Yeah. You know what? What's really... I remembered something that's very funny. Xerius, go ahead and subtract 14 damage from you. Oh, no, Xerius wasn't in range of that. Never mind. What? Everyone forgot that everyone got plus two bonuses, two attacks and damage rolls from Courageous Anthem, but it only applied to Sam and Maz, and Ardrill. I haven't made an attack roll yet. Yeah. You just went away because Ardrill's turn started. What are you trying to do, Maz? I'm performing Lingering Composition. Okay. Success. And then I will be casting Dirge of Doom. Okay. Did you want to move first so that you hit all of them? Well, it's Seven Nations, so the question is do I move now anyway? Because once I move, they just enter it. It's a free action to activate Lingering Composition. Yes, and I've now used one action by activating Dirge of Doom. Okay. And then I... Sure, I will... Forget to link Dirge of Doom, even though I'm pretty sure it makes them frightened. Sure. That is absolutely correct. It sure does. Dirge of Doom, brain one. Also, he's Lingering Composition. I don't have Lingering Composition. Why can't I move my... Sure, I will step to here. Okay. Why does this not move with me? That's so annoying. Do you want me to just give you 30 and 60? Sure. So the answer is I can't do it. Got it. And then for my single extra action... I will... I will... I'll just cast Shield on myself. I'll reach my shield. Oh, no, not that. That's terrible. There we go. So many auras. That's my turn. All right, you're casting Shield, Lingering Composition. Shield, Lingering Composition. Dirge of Doom. Okay, cool. I'm stuck. Sierra, it's your turn. Does anybody have a healing potion that Zarius can drink? I have one. I have a few, probably. I'll be okay. I can take it. You can take it. I can get people to heal you. I'm just going to try and shoot you, then. You're going to shoot me? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm going to try and shoot you with my life shot to try and heal you up. I'm going to activate the ammunition. You see a wave of healing energy. Start charging on my arm gun. And if you're willing to be hit by it, you're off guard against it. Yeah. Yeah. 25 hit you off guard what is off do I have to like lower off guard what's your AT minus 2 that meets beats you so you heal 18 damage yay we did it Patrick we saved town and then I'm gonna use defiant bandit again give everyone more DR the same amount of DR not more DR 5 and that's my turn activate shoot DR done okay this guy Emily you are going to get stabbed in the back potentially stab me someone yeah missed that 36 versus your AT 36 36 versus your off guard AC I believe that is a crit I think I think it is a crit yeah yeah you are going to take with a minus 1 for what it's worth 35 with that still crits because you're 24 yes yeah so one second 34 minus 5 damage 29 I don't have the capacity to do mental math right now 29 generally 103 minus 29 yes it's 104 minus 30 so 74 I don't know brain no function don't do that weird math shit for me I mean do the weird math shit but like I just can't do that right now but you add you add enough number to both numbers to make the the one you're subtracting equal to divisible by 10 and you just can subtract by 10 I'm going to swing at you again Emily okay he's going to miss he'll swing a third time and miss thank god your drill it's your turn okay I'm going to make blue my hunted prey okay okay okay I am going to oh wait I have reactions yes oh my god I've been smacked and I didn't smack anybody back can I smack him back sure you

any reason uh trying to think wait actually wait stop minus 1 nope that actually hits because the minus 1 from the fear 19 damage and then whoever what's up in the thing yep the next person to strike

their attacks so it's just 34 damage from that person 34 i hurt i see that reen is uh going to attempt to uh actually reen is going to uh rush around like this and they are going to swing on you zarius is that not broken away from jack does if jack wants to take it well like i also smack blue for smacking me uh reactions i have i have two reactions are they both reactive strike yes then yeah you can definitely swing on blue for him yeah i have to go to the right side i think i have to go to the right side because i got i have my regular reaction and then i have my tactical reflex which is i get an additional reaction that can be used only as a reactive strike and if these are both reactive strikes then yeah well only one has to be a reactive strike well i already reactive striked to other dude i've done one reactive strike as long as these are as long as it's a reactive strike uh i'm not sure if i'm going to get a reactive strike um no i'm not this is a reactive strike there's a 31 hit yeah that person's dead okay great he tried yeah perfect one they had one hp yeah so you only took so you get 70 hit points back because you killed them before they got their second and third hit off right no no emily should have remembered after the first hit that's true it's okay i'm not that worried about it green's going to spin around here um and swing on xerius uh 30 versus your ac is xerius uh well doesn't the sorry 29 versus your ac doesn't the arcane cascade give me like five or is it only gets magic i forget i i don't know man how does it work if you link it to me i can tell you what it does i'm trying to remember is it not is it not in your character sheet for you i don't know man how does it work if you link it to me i can tell you what it does i'm trying to remember is it not is it not in your character sheet for you just click on to link it it's not in the i think it's in this character sheet on the 20. or maybe it is and i'm blind and it's there and don't you get a special because you have your don't forget you also have a special thing which i believe actually just adds movement speed to your movement because you're unarmored we went hybrid studies and you were laughing shadow you get a plus 10 bonus to your movement speed if you're unarmored and you have no benefits no for one yeah uh 29 versus gracie i take it 19 damage minus five so 14 damage 49 14. 14. 14. 39 35. i always thought arcane cascade gave me a plus five i don't know uh they're gonna swing on you again 27 versus your ac meets 26 versus your ac miss is the 27 with the minus one just now the 26th with the minus one okay okay yeah yeah yeah uh jack it's your turn didn't jack just have a treat no jack had a reaction i had some reactions um i'm gonna smack i'm gonna smack the green one okay this is what i want to do hold up yes okay i'm gonna dueling perry and then i'm gonna slam down the green one yes okay i'm gonna dueling perry and then i'm gonna slam down the green one on green okay okay so do a sneaky smack 33 crits roll some damage it takes 1d4 persistent fire damage from our blazing banner if he lives roll athletics to trip uh trip fail oh well 17 take your 17 bludgeoning is it the damage i could really take it I crit them, Daniel. And is an archer going to crit them? Actually, I can't use it. It's only a... It's either... I've got to change out some of my stuff, but it's only if I have a crossbow or a firearm. A loaded crossbow or firearm. I want to look at it. It still takes the 1d4 persistent fire damage, so... Unless Joey wants to let me use it, but... I'll have to check your thing. It's the... We'll worry about it later. Jack, that's your turn. Zarius, you're up. Alright, now we're going to spell strike this bitch. Matt Green. Remember about the persistent fire? Sorry. I guess I need to roll that, don't I? Yes, at the end of their turn. One. Awesome. One damage at the end of their turn. I don't know why I bother. I could just die right now. Hey, Blue had one hit point left. Yeah, I'm hitting the green. Spell strike, so we're going to hit with... the rapier. You gave me special rapier, so I get... two? I'm going to use the thing, right? Do you have to declare that before your attack? Okay, sorry. I'm declaring that before my attack. Cool. Roll to hit twice more. Three times total? Three times total. 26 is your highest attack, so we'll take that. And 15 is your damage. Alright. That was your first damage. You'll deal 15 damage with that, and then roll your spell that you're doing with your special. Let's do the Gougeon Claw. It always goes well. Look at that. Okay, so a total of... 29. 29 damage. Okay. They are fucked up. Well, let's look. Do I have... actually... Did I have... The real question is, do you remember to upgrade the damage of your Gougeon Claw properly? Probably not. That I gotta work on. My other question was... Where did it go? Don't I have greater weapon... Don't I have some sort of weapon specialization at this point? I don't know, man. I'll have to double-check. Well, then, no worries about it right now. We're good. Oh, plus two, because I'm hyper-studied. What does that say? Plus your Arcan Cascade, so... You're not flat-footed, so you add... You add... two more damage, at least. So that is... actually... You probably have... You probably have weapon specialization at this point. That's what I was thinking, so it's three. No, it's five if you have weapon... Oh, yeah, it's three. It's three. If you had stepped to get in, did you want to step first, that you would have a blank game? Uh, yeah, fuck it, I have steps. You would have stepped first, then free action. So that actually increases it to five. That is what we're looking for. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Now that's definitely your turn. Maz, you're up. Alright. We're in a... electric arc. Okay. You didn't need to step. The person was smacked. No, they weren't. They weren't tripped. Never mind. They were not tripped. We will electric arc the two. Okay. Reflex save? Yep. Two reflex saves. Alright. Green got a 28. And the uncolored person got a 36. Okay. 28 should succeed. Was that with... Dirge of Doom? That was... That's a 27 with Dirge of Doom. Okay, so that's a failure, then. And then the other one succeeds. So that's this. Green is dead. Okay. That person's not at that much HP. That person is hurt. Okay, we are going to send a... level... five? Five? Yeah, level five. Uh, force barrage his way. So one level five force barrage. That is correct. One level five force barrage. Uh, well, sorry. Sorry, that's... Well, it's heightened from... So it's... Spell ring five. I think it's only heightened two times, if I understand this correctly. It's heightened twice. So I believe it's 3d4 damage? Yeah, 3d4 damage. Love that. You'll have to see it. Wait, that's all wrong. What? That's very wrong. Roll 3d4, and then we'll add a 12? Not a 12. Uh, it should be just, uh... Should be 3d4 plus three. Because it's 1d4 plus one. Wow. Wow! Now that's a roll, baby. So that's a total of six damage. I'm checking force barrage. I hope it... That linked it. You got a hero point? You got a hero point? Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah. You can't hero point those rolls. So, six damage. That's my turn. All three actions. You can hero point anything. No, you can't. I wish that were true. Sierra's your turn. Which one of you has a better range spell to use to kill someone? That won't explode us. Um, yeah, I got teleconnect projectile. Also, electric arc again, but... In this case, we'll just use teleconnect projectile. I can't... So, I wanted to use slip and sizzle, which I've been trying to do all encounter, so I'm going to shut up about it at some point. It lets someone with a spell that... A ranged spell that deals damage, they get to cast it as a reaction. It costs two actions or less. If it's not a cantrip, which if it uses a slot or a focus spell, then you are slowed on your next turn. Slowed one, you don't get a reaction. It is a cantrip. Well, teleconnect projectile is what I would use here, and that is a cantrip. Okay. So, we're going to use slip and sizzle. We're going to tell Jack to try and trip the colorless man. You said green died, right? Green's dead, yeah. Sorry, I forgot. Jack, try and trip the colorless man. Okay. That was a 38. 38 trips. 38, I think, crits. There's a cat bothering me, though. 38 crits. Roll a d6. I know Jack's a real problem. There we go. Okay. Execute a brutal technique, sign a knockdown on an opponent, and blast with magical devastation. So, the trip was successful. So, Maz, line him up. 27 hits. You will deal 14 damage as you, I don't know, grab a stone and smack him in the face. 13 damage sounds wrong. I'm going to use defiant banner, and that's going to be my turn. I'm going to have to screw with this. Oh, okay. 13 damage sounds wrong. 13 damage probably is wrong. 66. So, I don't... 13 damage is possible, I suppose. Now you roll. I have no idea. That guy's turn. That guy's going to stand up, Emily. Macabitch. Macabitch. 24 hits. Other. Current level. D6. He dies. Oh, that's why. Wait, no. He stood up and fell down promptly. He tried to stand up, and Emily shoved his sword through her... I said no. Emily shoved his sword through his spine. There we go. I said sit down. Right. Since we went way over time... I'm going to stand up from prone now, too, actually. Yes. Yes. Since we went... Way over time. That session, guys. This was just a quick little reminder of how to play Pathfinder. Yep. I'm going to have to make a spreadsheet for my character that has all my actions on it, because I have too many. I'm going to have to do some work, because I'm pre-doing a bit of mods. All your spells are probably out of date. Well, I'm also basically changing my ancestry up, because the Cretia was not doing much for me, which probably nobody remembers I was. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I did. I did. I agree you're a Cretia. Well, I'm no longer going to be a Cretia. I'll be a variant human, but... You're a Cretia? Yeah. Right? Like I said, nobody remembers it. I remembered it. Because Gith wasn't real, right? Yeah, Gith still isn't real. Oh. But anyway, I'm going to end up with like a psychic dedication sort of shit, so... Because it's far more fitting for being Gith. Uh... So. There's actually... There's actually a... Uh... If you go look at the Starfighter... stuff there's actually um alishunta right alishunta is basically a gif like straight up
