 you beetle beetle people beetle people they were they were riding beetles yeah yeah yeah so they were beetlemen like I said uh I scared the piss out of one of the bandits you did um uh we figure out that there's a whole bunch of censors in the city and so they have to like guide us around that yup um there's even an Ivan uh they won't tell us what we're guarding and but it was more like I wanted to make sure we weren't gonna die and he said we weren't gonna get eaten to my question he couldn't guarantee that you wouldn't die because you know you guys were on guard duty yeah but I asked like would we be blown up or poisoned or eaten and he was like you won't get eaten and I was like well he can't guarantee those other ones because you're on guard duty someone could come by with grenades you know something to blow you guys up with something could also eat us while we're on guard duty you you he specifically said you will not be eaten by any of us by any of our animals sounds good to me either way yeah it was frightful it was very specific wording it was very specific wording and it was very not certain wording um but yeah and then we fought some people who were riding beetles which was kind of cool mm-hmm which is a nice easy combat to get us back into the groove of playing the game so that you know remind us how our characters work mm-hmm that's that's pretty much all of it good job Emily thanks would you like a free point of inspiration yeah okay you can have a free point of inspiration all righty which brings us to the start um I believe that's not a hero point so it's it's pretty useless oh sorry it's a hero point inspiration it's all the same shit well if it was all the same shit then Emily points and Jacob points would also be points of inspiration but those are different things the ratio's off yeah you have to you have to get a million and one Jacob points to get a Joey point and then you need two million and two Joey points to get a higher point and then you need exponentially three million and three point high points to get a hero point mm-hmm mm-hmm so the market's not good I hear no no the market's not good yeah so Emily can just give like a free point of inspiration 12 million points yeah but see if you do that that causes inflation and all those then the market would crash and then it's like uh who's line is it anyway yeah the rules are made up and the points don't matter except for when they do matter when they don't matter all right so I believe that's it I believe when we ended you guys had just finished combat yes um you guys are probably also looking at the wrong map yes I'm looking at a map it's not the right map that's the right we weren't looking at the wrong map we were given the wrong map we were placed on it incorrectly well technically you were just on the leftover map from the previous group oh I should tell you the funny thing that happened to them oh lord do they take notes no they never take notes why would they do that? you said that so? Michelle was starting to take notes she was and then I think she stopped because it was I don't know I think I think she forgot she was starting to take notes because they're allergic to notes apparently the notes would be helpful um so they were trying to determine their route from the hanging city to where they're going um and through a series of unfortunate roles they are now passing through a place known as the black hole bog inspired by the black hole bog by one the one the only zap brannigan love it yeah I don't know if I know that episode specifically uh it's the one where they're on the titanic in space and zap instead of you know following the set route by right right right by straight past a black hole love it yeah so who's zap brannigan in this uh in this instance uh do they have a guide? no just started it by rolling uh a crit failure then zell confirmed the crit failure by rolling another crit failure and then everyone failed to roll a success to everyone else failed to roll a success to prove them wrong and they're just like well we have no evidence on this map to dispute your claims so we're gonna go that way so oh boy through a series of unfortunate roles they are now passing through a place called the black hole bog pretty funny I've been laughing about it um they're all pretty sure they're gonna die but you know I would never do that intentionally all right so that's the funny thing that happened to the other group um cool and I believe we left off right at the end of this combat yes yes cool all righty um well you guys just finished this combat as we tune into our characters uh is there anything you guys want to do with these bodies or are we just gonna leave them here and continue on your way yo loot em loot loot the body dun dun nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh a perception check from anyone who wants to loot dem bodies loot the body loot the body honor matter which one. They could just be lying to you about, they're obviously lying to you about their names, but Right, true, truly Yeah Uh The less we know, the better did we not understand Yeah, exactly. Alright So, from this group of individuals, you guys all rolled high enough to find all of the stuff We have four Four? Four Plus one malts Four suits of studded leather One short sword, one lesser healing potion, one moderate glue bomb a sling with ten bullets and another suit of studded leather And for shiggles Uh Twenty gold pieces You know, divided them up It's what, a bomb of sticky? A moderate glue bomb Moderate glue bomb I'm just gonna write down the good stuff Mm-hmm I.E. the potion of lesser healing, the moderate glue bomb and the twenty gold pieces But you could take all the rest of it and sell it because, you know How much does that cost in gold? Aren't plus one malts only worth like thirty-five gold? Probably But, like, that's You know, there's four of them, so Don't we have a bag of holding by now? Uh, if you guys don't, you guys do now Is there a reason for you guys not to have a bag of holding? I'm pretty sure we do I do I do have a I have a bag of holding Type one I mean, thirty-five That's a hundred and forty gold cut in So that's seventy gold right there from just the malls by themselves I should put these in here Like, that's seventy gold at the minute? Minimum Moz could probably Plus one Get that number up And what, five suits of studded leather? Five suits of studded leather, that's not worth much But probably What's the difference between leather and studded leather? The amount of AC it provides in your dex bonus And probably the price Because I have leather armor now Does anybody want the potion of lesser healing, the moderate glue bomb, and the five suits of studded leather? I'm not sure if that's the right word for it The moderate glue bomb, or... Well, I guess twenty gold pieces We don't have party funds No, you guys just, everyone just, one person just keeps track of all the gold Leather is four plus one Leather is one plus four And studded is less, is probably two plus three It's two plus three My gold is way off, so I don't know if we should be using my gold Because I have over a thousand golds On my character sheet That's probably accurate, I was giving out gold like candy And you guys just weren't using it Okay, I'll just add it Like, I'm pretty sure Gabe has like two thousand gold pieces on his character sheet Anybody, lesser potion of healing? Potion of lesser healing, moderate glue bomb? And or? I'll take a glue bomb, why not? Alright, take a glue bomb, a moderate glue bomb Potion of lesser healing is 2d8 plus five, for those curious I mean, I'll take it, if no one's gonna hold it, I'll hold it I mean, I can I can hold it, but you know, I also heal some shit, so Look, me and you get hit the hardest, so Listen, who's feeling the worst right now? I have 40 HP, how you doing? 35 Okay, you take the potion of lesser healing Alright, you said 2d8 plus what? Plus five I'm just gonna roll that shit Do it Plus five I mean, you guys could You guys could medicine, don't you? You guys could short rest on the carts and keep going at this point You guys looted all the bodies It didn't hit ten minutes to get focus points back Yeah, again, you guys can just get on the carts and just ride at this point Yeah, I mean, we were just going, but I was just gonna take the healing and the medicine There you go, Jacob, that's what your moderate glue bomb does Cool Thanks For copypasting Copy Paste I don't like it I actually, I have the answer to that one It was May It was sometime in May in 2020 When we started Alright So yeah, he's like, you know, two gold, you know, three gold, two gold to unload the carts, you know?

So, he, he shows you out and you guys are now in, I knew I forgot to do something. I forgot to name the four city-states in Silvermoor. One of them is named Silverleaf. Oh, there we go. You guys are in Silverleaf of Silvermoor. There we go. There's Silverleaf. There's Highgarden. There's... Fuck. It's late. My brain shut down in the middle of it. Iron Islands. Ho and Jodo, Kanto, and Sinnoh. I kind of wanted to stick with the plant theme, so we'll come up with the other two later. Silvervine? No, we already used Silver. We could do Goldvine, though. We could do Goldvine. Goldvine. And we'll figure out the other one later. Ivy Lane. I don't think a city would be named Ivy Lane. You said it was a district. No, I said they were cities. I thought Silvermoor was the city. No, Silvermoor is a collection of city-states. Yes. That all work together. Joey, we have a place here called Newport News. Okay. We have a city called Goochland. I don't think there are rules about what you can call a city. I'm just saying Ivy Lane sounds like a street. Well, it's okay, because it's going to be Ivymont. I don't know what that means. There's an Ivymont shopping center in Midlothian. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's the only place in the city. Yeah. The only place in the city. Yeah. I think that's the only place in the city. Yeah. I think that's the only place in the city. I literally thought you were talking about some D&D location you visited. Yeah. Yeah. Like in Midlothian. And there was a Kroger there. I was like, huh? I mean, we...

This is not fun for me, Joey. I wanted to beat a man up for being annoying. So, Ardrill, as you go to walk around the building, you spot a collection of wanted posters. By the order of Governor Little, these people are wanted for actions against the city. And right there, smack dab in the middle, with the highest bounty, is your face. Why my face? Read your own background. Read your own background? Oh, is Governor Little? Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Booyah. Booyah. John Little. Okay, I gotta look at my... Sorry, JetGPT wrote this, so... Oh, I know. Oh, I know. JetGPT wrote all of your backgrounds. JetGPT didn't write my background. I wrote my background, sir. Oh, I'm so sorry, Emily. It wrote literally everyone else's background. Same for me. You weren't implied in that, Sam. Okay. I know you wrote your own background. No, you should have seen the original version that I got of Zarius's background. Yep. Oh, I still like that. Oh, that's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. I had to do some effort so that it was legible. But Zarius is the most... Obvious case. JetGPT. Hi. Hi. That was back when JetGPT first touched my fingers. That was literally... I think that was genuinely the very first time I ever touched JetGPT. He was like, hey, use this. Sorry to throw you under the bus, but... It was like, yo, try this and see. And I did. And I did not touch it afterwards. Although I have bettered my backstory since then in my own notes, because I have Zarius a part of another campaign, kind of, not really. So I just haven't updated it. I can't believe you're cheating on me. So... No, it's not like he's playing. He's not a player character in another campaign. Okay. He's a feature. Well, I put my hood up over my face. Yeah, NPC. Where is my background? A bio-network. Info. Do I see a... Oh. Oh. That's so funny. Are you from here, Sam? You're not from Silverleaf. I'm from Silvermore, are you? No. Oh. Yeah. No, you don't see... No. Only you are on the one I posted. I don't think I have any bounties. I don't think I have bounties. Argyle has a... Argyle has a bounty. He has a bounty because Governor... How much is... Mayor Little became Governor Little, and Governor Little is very corrupt. How much is my bounty? It is currently sitting at 50 gold pieces, the highest out of all of them. Oh. Okay. Don't spend it all in one place. So I'll walk back to everyone. I tell them what's up. Basically, the guy that ruined my town is... In charge here. Oh. Sounds fun. We're going to topple government while we're here? Sounds like it. So glad that Argyle was the one who got to discover that. Are you bringing back your poster? I'd be like, look, guys, I'm famous. You can sign it. Yeah. My nose looks a little big, but, you know. I also want to point out, this is a recent picture of you. Like, this is not an old picture of you. This is a recent picture. Is it a picture or a drawing? Well, I mean... Drawing picture. Because that happened not that long ago. Did it happen in the year gap? Yeah, all this happened in the year gap. Oh, this is... This is... This... This gear, like you can tell from some of the gear on there, was the same gear that you had on it. The seat of the Thunderlord. Okay. So you had people spying on me there, I guess. Yes, people. Spying on you. Probably not. So, we got back from the cognitive plane. We had that year gap. During that year gap, I went home to where I was from with my grandfather, and John Little was the mayor. Super corrupt. Took over everything. Was basically... Uh-oh. John from Robin Hood. Turned everything bad, and I overthrew him. Kicked him out of the city. But he appears to be back. Yeah, he made it out. I don't know how I feel about his name being John Little. When Little John is supposed to be your BFF. Robin Hood. It's backwards, though. It's backwards, yeah. It's the opposite. Then are we going to find Hood Robin? Maybe. Argyle is Hood Robin. I am Hood Robin. I put my hood up. But Little John is your BFF. Yeah, that's why it's John Little. But then... What are you not getting? It's quite simple. None of it. None of it. All of it. Some of it. When did I get my swords? You definitely got one from Horbach. Definitely got one. From Horbach. Was that at the... That would be at the seat of the Thunderlord, yeah. Is the sword in the picture? The sword is not in the picture. Okay. Okay. So I probably should... Nah, I'm not going to do that. Wait. So, okay. Just so that I have this right. You explained that John Little, like, took over your town and was exploiting it. And then you came back and, like, fucked him up and chased him out of town. Is that what happened? Yep. So I go up to our buddy, Yvonne. I give him a big hug. And I make sure everyone sees me that he is my friend. Oh, my God. Well, your hood's up. So, yeah, everyone's just like, wow, that guy's hugging the smuggler. That guy must be tough. I take my hood. I take my hood down. Well, then they're all seeing you from the back, so no one knows it's you. And I turn around and smile and wave at everybody. And so this is my best bud, Yvonne. Oh, you are very bad for business. That's okay. They will all forget that in a few days anyways. And then I raise my hood up and start walking away. Slink away. And here I thought I was the only one with shady secrets. Well, his isn't shady. His is quite opposite of shady. Nobody told me he had a bounty on his head. I could be 50 gold. I could be gold richer. He didn't know he had a bounty on his head. Oh. We should definitely do some sort of con here where I turn you in. Yeah, exactly. And then I'm 50 GP richer. And then, listen, we can do that. Multiple times. Three more times. We could be 200 gold richer. Actually, maybe 250. Maybe we could have him turn himself in for 50 gold. I don't think they would pay him for turning himself in. Yeah, you got it. You got it. You got to do it. They're not going to pay you for going to prison. You could also, in theory, turn him in with each of you. Oh, you already. Yeah. I know, but that's only four. I mean, we could use it to get to see. Oh, Johnny. Boy. Why would we want to see Johnny boy? Do you think he's going to know where the weapons are? We're looking for weapons. Remember? Oh, yeah. Wait, this is a smuggler. You know. That's important. Do we know? Do we know anything about. Where the weapons are. It's a great question. Everyone will perception. Let me just loop it back to what we're actually here for. Guys. I would. We're just having a good time on a caravan. And man, I just. I just like. You know. All right. So everyone passed. Oh, it hasn't rolled yet. Who hasn't rolled? Serious. I haven't rolled. I was not at my computer. I'm sorry. All right. So everyone. Give me one second. Off in the distance. You can see. The very top. Of. This. Shiny. Light. Blue pyramid. That is just. Off in the distance. And. Argyle. You're. Giant weapon. Argyle. You were for around here. That wasn't here a year ago. So this is my home. I mean. I mean. You didn't really say where you were from. So yeah. You're around here. Okay. Maybe. You're. You're. You're. The city you were a part of. Is not one of the big city states. But it was one of the. One of the town you're a part of is. Okay. You know. In silver more somewhere. Okay. So that wasn't here before. Yeah. Wow. I want to go right. City states. And I wrote silver states. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I was in the city. I was in the city. And I was like, that's not right. That's close to right though. Sorry. I was away from my keyboard. I was a day. No clean away for a minute. I'm so sorry. I found some good news. And then I was. At the. I think. So. Sorry. This is a little off topic. I know. Oh. I've. I've. I've. I've. I've. I've. I've. I've. I've. I've. I've. I've been trying to have my career of being a pilot and all that, if you guys all know that kind of stuff. Well, so I did my big test that allows me to make money teaching people back at the end of December. And I basically needed my one little extra rating. But, you know, people would people can hire me, but they want to see that extra rating. Right. And. So I started applying to places as I'm getting this extra rating and my instructor. Is apparently about to put in his two weeks, he just told me, so I might be taking his spot is my goal. Oh, that would be the fucking best blessing you can imagine. Right. Like right as I'm finishing up, he's just like, OK, have my job. See, here's my students. You go make sure. I mean, he's been waiting for his like because he got hired at. West Jet Jet West. Stop. No, fuck. It's not it's not Southwest. It's like West Jet. I'm pretty sure. But he's been waiting for his class date for a year to start. Jesus. And apparently he just got it. Well, the covid stuff forced early retires, so they ramped up hiring. But then they can only ramp it up so much. But they promised all these people that they could work. And so they have all these people who can take it, but no class dates because they only have. So much capacity. So he's been one of those people who just got fucked by being accepted without an actual spot in a classroom because they have certain capacity. Interesting. So sorry, that was a little random tidbit off topic of the night. But that's why I was away. I saw him calling me really quick. So I answered that. Real life happens. Yeah. So to recap, there is now some sort of giant blue shining pyramid. That is randomly. Here in Silvermore. And that was not here like a second ago or was no, it was not here. It wasn't here about a year ago. OK, I was going to say, like, appeared in the past few seconds. No, Emily asked about the pyramid and I said we get back to that. So I had to explain the pyramid. OK. And that's where all the goods are. I didn't. I can neither confirm nor deny that. Yeah. But it's a point of interest. Out of my town. Ran him out of his town and into this one. This is a city. This is the city of Silverleaf. My town was like at the. Yeah, my town was like at the. Edge of the area. Yeah. Actually, my city. You tell me the name of the town I was from at one point. Originally. You know, it's so long ago. I don't remember what it is. Unless it's like actually in your backstory. I'm still just going to. Move the city into silver more. Yeah. Changes basically nothing. Yeah. It's not even listed in here. No, it's not in mine. Yeah. I'll try to find it just to give it a name. Yeah. Alrighty. Alrighty. So yeah, there's a, there's a, there's a big pyramid. Cool. What are you guys up to? Um, well. Shit. Shit. became pink. Yeah, and, uh, I'm fairly sure that this is all random or Luft. ShaNox on the JG is going ahead with you. I'm sorry, I just I. Okay. I'm going to I'm going with that. Do a shout out. Okay. I've got bruise shoes. My face. Uh, Thank you so much, Kate. What? I don't want to chat with you. Thanks. I thought of it myself yes embrace the chaos Sam apparently Tao leaving had a profound effect upon the party I'm flattered oh you know what we had a discussion about with the weekend group do they also have PTSD no we realized that they failed every single one of their missions nice sounds about right uh huh you got the guy which you you got the guy you figured out what was causing it and you got the guy you just lost Tao you technically succeeded there and you guys succeeded at at uh you guys mostly succeeded at Exolos I think we succeeded handily half the city got destroyed through a hurricane but that was out of your control I mean shit are you gonna blame us for hurricanes I mean who could have known D&D would do what it did and then revert itself who could have known Hazard was gonna do the dumbest thing possible hey that's true I think for the most part Exolos went off well the scene of the Lullard was a big one and just to be perfectly honest like that was just very difficult it was just a because you guys without Star Wars and you're not playing those things you know then you're gonna get constructed after the yeah you did not hold as many L's as the other group they literally failed every single one of their missions they didn't stop air the blood support coliseums at Aereins and in fact they failed so hard at stopping them that you know like the demons now have an army of people and then they failed to get the army from the Feywilds and in fact they failed so hard at that that the army that they were going for is now serving and Moondragon in the far north yeah but not working for you guys working for the dragon and the dragon is not our friend but not our enemy yeah and they went down to save the cavern elves city and half of the city got destroyed and one of the commanders for the cavern elf army also died so yeah they kind of held the L all over the place so you guys did a lot better than the other group but I mean did they discuss that with you no one knows I Joey can tell you Ian that they did theirs went a lot worse yeah yeah yeah did IGo so what's up your lord iscillary dude Ro 인 dude dude dude off guard. Yeah, it's been a while. Well, when I came home, I came through here. And that big pyramid was not there. Hmm. Yeah. We have a little wander in there. It's worth going to check it out. What's a good place to get supplies for a pyramid run? Society checker just makes them clean up, I believe you. We live in a society. Me make a society check? Yeah. You make a society check or just literally make something up? Yeah, I said the thing for you. Do it. We live in a society. But not the smuggler store, but there's another store not far from here. What's the name of that other store? Zorab's Emporium. Zorab's Emporium. Weapons Emporium. I don't know. I'll just go with Emporium. Hmm. Because I miserably misspelled Emporium, but... Just don't misspell Zorab. I'm pretty sure that's Z-O-R-E-B. I put Ab-A-B. But then, the way he was saying it, I was like, is it Zorab? Like, with a P at the end? I don't know. Well, I heard Zorab. Zorab. I was like, yeah, E-B. I was looking at my old notes, and there was a Zorab at some point with an I. Sure. There's a lot of Z names in this campaign for a while. Just like how there's Saktar and Saktar and Sackmore and Sackdor. These do not remind me of all the Z names I'm in. Yeah. Alrighty. You guys want to go to Zorab's Emporium? I guess so. You guys go to Zorab's Emporium? It's a relatively small shop, but it's well-stocked and well-laid out, so there's a ton of room, and the shelves are very full. And just sitting behind the counter, you see a little halfling, and he's like, Hello! Welcome to Zorab's Emporium! My name is, uh, Cole. How may I help you today? Why does he sound like this? I don't know. Why is his name Cole? Because Cole works at Zorab's Emporium. He's not Zorab. He's not Zorab, okay. Hey, Cole. Can you tell me, is this city run by squids? So, like, do you mean, like, the, the, the sea animal squids? You know, the ink sacs, and when they get freaked out, they, like, drop the water? Like the racial slur squids. Whoa! I'm so sorry for her. Yeah, like mind flayers. Oh, yeah. Squid heads. Is there an official better term that we don't use that we should use? You know, I... I mean, I think the non-racist term is to call them... Mind flayers, or whatever. I mean, is that a racist term? Illithids. Illithids! Right? Illithids. Squids. Stop it, dude. That's, like, the N-word for these people. You gotta chill. I take it you guys came in through Yvonne... The back. Mm-hmm. Okay. So, legally, at this point, I do have to hit the alarm. But it usually takes the guards about five minutes to get here. So... We have money. We have money. So, what I am saying is I have to hit the alarm and even... And you've got five minutes. And you guys have got five minutes after I hit the alarm to buy the shit you need and get the fuck out. So, that means we have four minutes because the guards will be here at the five-minute mark. But also, you're gonna tell me about the squids. That's what I need. Are you going to trap them so they can't sling the alarm? I'm not gonna... This guy's gotta do what this guy's gotta do. I'm not gonna jeopardize his business. He's a small business owner. This is way above him. He literally just works here. He's just doing his job. So, you don't even get paid enough to hit the button. Man, you don't get paid enough to hit the button. He doesn't get paid enough to not hit the button. What if I say... What if I say, hey, do we have a gun? What if I hold my sword up to his throat? I mean, he can't hit the button under threat. I'm just saying. I'm asking. Would you do it if I held a sword up to you? You wouldn't get in trouble. If I don't hit the button, they find out, we get shut down. No, but I had a sword to your throat. So, you can't hit the button. It's like a bank, right? I still have to hit the button. Yeah, after I drop my sword. Okay, but then how are you going to go buy stuff? I'm fine standing right here. They can shop around. Then we have five minutes. And what's to stop me from just hitting the button under the counter? You know, I could have already done that. Look what I'm telling you. I think we're running through time already. Let's just go ahead and talk to the man. What I'm telling you is I have to hit the button and it takes five minutes for the guards to get here. So, maybe grab your shit while I hit the button and get the fuck out and I'll answer the nice, little cat persons and I'll answer the cat folks' questions. Okay, hit the button. Walk away. Okay. And go. Hit the button. Okay, so what questions do you have for me, cat folk? We've got about four minutes, 50 seconds. So, I'm assuming the squids are here, yes? They took over about two weeks ago. They swooped in. All of the government officials said, these are the new rulers of Silvermoor and they set up shop. Is he a squid person now? Is that new leader, Governor Little? Or one of the leaders? No, no, no. Governor Little pledges fealty to the squids. Yeah. So, they're still up in their floating city where they rain from above. Okay. What's the new pyramid? The new pyramid, they dropped that off here like a month ago, because the governor was like, hey, this is where all the new jobs are going to come from. So, Ward Lord Jurgen approved of this. And then they dropped that here. And then we were like, wow, that's kind of messed up. You're going to let the Ring City? They kind of seem like the enemies right now. You know, with what we're hearing on the news, you know, Ring City flies over a place, people get abducted. And now, like, you know, the city criers. You know, Ring City flies over, people get abducted, go missing. Good job. We got four minutes left. What, okay, what kind of jobs are in the pyramid? What are they doing? What are they doing in there? Look, everyone who's into the pyramid doesn't come out of the pyramid. That's all I know. That's all I know. Okay. Going to pyramid, don't come out. We're also going to buy stuff after she's done. I mean, I would just bring it up to me and I'll sell it to you. And, you know, while she does the talking, that's probably smarter. Do you have a list of your wares? Because I'm physically not there and can't look. You literally just tell me if you want to buy anything and he has it. Oh, okay. Sorry, continue. Anyways, okay. We got, like, it's four minutes. It's one minute since I hit the button. What's up? Okay. Chop the pyramid off. Is there a curfew? Yeah, of course there's a curfew. The curfew's at, like, 10 o'clock. You know, actually, well, they close the gates the second night sits, and then you have to be in your homes at 10. So you can't leave the town once it's night. You know? Okay, so the gates close at sundown. Yeah, gates close at sundown. Must be in your home at 10. Anyone caught breaking curfew goes to work in the pyramid. Certainly there's got to be rumors about what they're doing in there. What kind of rumors have you heard? The rumors I've heard is once you go in the pyramid, you don't come back out. And so because no one comes back out, there's no rumors about what goes on inside the pyramid. Hmm. Okay. Is there, like, I guess, sensors and stuff in this town to, like, to catch you after hours? Sneak around? Yeah. Do you have anything that can help us detect those? No, I don't. That would be illegal. You know, they check for those things, you know, on their weekly inspections. All right, I'm going to ask for the second time. Okay. Thanks. What did you hear? But I heard that there is a, a smuggler nearby who might have something that can detect them. So. But I wouldn't know any about that. I work at Zorab's Emporium, a legitimate business. So what would an illegitimate business sound like? It would. What level of health pots would you like? Graders are. I was about to say, those are very expensive. Yeah. I was going to say. Only if they pay for them. That's true. We've already been called the cops on. What's stealing going to do? 400 each for graders. Yeah. Oh, shit. They might be free for moderates. And the difference is it's happy healing. Thank you. Does he have a disguise kit? Yeah, he's got a disguise kit. Oh, yeah. Your friend's going to need that disguise kit, isn't he? He does look like the wanted poster. That sucks, man. That sucks. You get here and then like. What do you mean? He doesn't look like anything. Look, just because you give him a black eye doesn't mean the rest of his facial structure doesn't match the wanted poster. I'm not. I'm, you know, I work in a poor business. I'm not dumb. Anyways. Gold pieces for disguise kit. Or do you want the good disguise kit at 4D gold pieces? I'll take the good one. Okay. Also, for you, for your niceness, I'll throw in disguise kit elite cosmetics refill for free. Sure. It's five silver pieces. You just bought something for 40 gold. He can afford to give you five silver pieces worth of stuff. Anything else you guys need? We got about two minutes left. Any other questions? Anybody else? Questions? Sierra? Sirius? Uh, no. I mean, I don't think he knows much else that's going to be useful. Do you have any, like, magic scrolls? Uh, what? Magic scrolls? A little hard to come by. We got one or two. Is there anything in particular you're looking for? You know, we got low level. I'm just curious what you got. We got low level stuff. You know, like level ones, level twos. But, you know, there's this. Apparently. There's a smuggling guy who's got a lot of stuff that he smuggles in. So, you know, maybe. Do you know where the smuggling guy might be in the direction I should go? I think it's even in Ivan's Emporium. It's even in Ivan's Emporium. There's stores. He's like, he said, there's stores on the main street. Just hit the main street and you'll find even in Ivan's Emporium. Sounds good. But that's their legitimate business front. I'll walk around the entrance and rear. Okay. Thank you. It was nice to see you. Watch out for the guards. I would head left out of the building. Not right. Left out of the building. Okay. We had left out of the building. Is there a street? You walk out. There's a wall there and you can go left or right. Oh, man. And I put to this guy. I use this guy's kid as we before we walk out. Oh, man. This is an action. If it's an action, you can you can go ahead and do that. Go ahead and roll me a deception. Because you can draw and replace a worn disguise. Get us part of the action that uses it. Yeah. Okay. Go ahead and roll me a deception check. 21. You because you have the giant black eye, you only need to do the other part of your face. But you still it looks like you put on makeup for the first time. But I'm still going to put my head up. Yeah. So you have a 21 as your DC for people to overcome your disguise. Get checked. Okay. That would be their perception. Yes. So as you guys walk out and go left, you see the guards running at you guys and they go into the building. You guys can hear them in there for about 30 seconds. And then you go back. Okay. And then after 30 seconds, they run out and go right. Do you have any contacts here, Jack? No. I can't say that I've ever been to Silverleaf. Or do I really want to hook up with any previous contacts? I got to lay low. Can't just stay in any tavern. Um. I mean, you would know which taverns to avoid better than I would. You're from round here, remember? Yeah. I love something nice, but for a time. So other than that, I would go the Sa Amelia Gate. And then I light up on it and then, yeah, however far you go, I would look up the ancient Miller. You have to look for ourselves around there. No, no, no. The V motels. You are now at I witch's order. It came at you. Yeah, and by that time, the v motels understand whoенature is. We are doing good. Major bubbles have speaking. Awesome. Nice job, Jack. Thanks for watching. Guys. Seriously Really good. Have a lab internally. Like a tavern. You know, a few streets off the main street that when you were here last wasn't really frequented by guards. Okay. I'll let them know that. Is that where you guys want to go? Sure. So as you are leading them to the tavern, let me check something. As we're leaving the shop? As you're, yeah, also, Jack, you're no longer clumsy. Oh, thanks. Sorry. Yeah, it's okay. Sorry, yeah, after you left the shop and the guards ran past the other direction, our drill is leading you guys to the tavern to, like, sit down and regroup. So there, that is, that is, there's that going on. The city is, it's very well maintained. Since you guys had the censors pointed out for you, you guys do spot a few of the different types of censors up on the walls and stuff looking around. So, you know, it's a nice leisurely walk down. Though, Jack, you do notice something very frustrating to you. Okay. Okay. You think someone has following your group. And they're bad at hiding their tracks. I make them my hunted prey. Jack hasn't pointed this out to you. I guess I would point them out to our drill. Okay. You can make them his hunted prey. I would know that. We're tag team buddies. Be like, hey, yo, do you also see this person following us? Not very well. Well, because, yes. Does this person seem threatening? Do I get a threatening aura? Uh, aura? With a 38, this individual doesn't seem to have a threatening aura about them when it comes to the crowd. This person seems to do a great job of, like, blending into the crowd, but they do a terrible job of making it look like they're not following you. Um, and so, like, let's turn our turn signal on and go the opposite direction. What was that? Let's put our turn signal on and then we'll go the opposite direction and see what they do. Sorry, it's late. Turn signal? That's okay. Okay. Can I use Hunter's Vision? Uh, what does Hunter's Vision do? It's a focus spell. That's the vibe check. Is he a hunted prey, though? He is, yeah. We already marked him. Sick. Hello, my friend. You can, you can do this to them if you'd like. Just remember, you know, casting magic is a loud activity. Um, let me see what traits it has. Uh, uncommon concentrate focus in Ranger. Do you have the subtle spell? No. Yeah, then casting magic is a loud endeavor. It's not, like, loud. It's just overt. It's just like talking and overtly magical, right? I mean, I can sit there and scream, like, spell cast! I mean, you say magic words, you do magical things, and it is a loud endeavor. People notice you casting magic. Yeah. So, you know, casting magic in the middle of a street when you're not a performer is, sounds, you know, cause for alarm. Let's go to the shelves. Let's be performers. Okay. I just stay focused on them, then. That's fine. So, do you guys go straight to the bar to try to lose your tail? Try to lose them. Tail's kind of cute. Okay. Uh, roll me stealth. As a group. So just, we'll say, uh, uh, if one more person succeeds, you guys lose them. Okay, you guys lost them. Can I direct us to, like, climb up a building or something? Sure. I have mountaineering training, so I can just give us all climb speeds. I mean, it's a little conspicuous to just start randomly climbing a building, but hey, it works in Assassin's Creed, so why couldn't it work here? Exactly. So, yeah, you guys climb up a building, and your tail walks by, and they go around the corner, and I'm like, where did they go? Um, and so, um, you lose sight of them. They, uh, they pick a direction, and they start walking it. It is not towards the tavern that you guys are going to. Are we in an alley now? You guys climbed up a building. But we're away from everyone. You're odd. I mean, you guys didn't go down an alley. You guys just picked a building and started climbing it. What I'm saying, if I did Hunter's Vision, would people notice it? I mean, you're on top of a building. So, less so? I mean, it's, you know, it's kind of the middle of the day, so the streets are pretty busy. So. I'm going to do Hunter's Vision, and that way he's lit up. And that way I'll see him if he comes around again. Mm-hmm. For the next ten minutes. Well, and the building will be out of sight, so it won't be as conspicuous to cast the spell. Yes. Yeah. Alrighty. I'm going to go ahead and do it. Do you guys want to now go follow that person, or do you guys want to head towards the tavern? How far away from your hunted prey do you have to be? Or, like, can you be? There's no, there's no range on it. Yeah. He's my, he's my hunted prey until... ...the next day. Until he's not. Or the, until the next day. Until, until I make my next daily preparations. So we could go get a room and then track him down. And we have an advantage now, because, because if they follow my lead, everybody can see him. Right, but again, all of the buildings would, would block him, so. And the people block your, your light up as well. I do have... I get a plus two bonus to perception and survival checks to him. I'm just, I'm just saying this, this, this light up is blocked by buildings and people. Yeah. So I, the, the question is, next time, do you guys want to go to the tavern? Or do you guys want to follow this individual? Let's go... I guess we're following the individual. I'm inclined to say follow, too. Alright, I heard three follows. And you'll have my sword. Alrighty, well, that's where we're going to end the day. Um, alright, that's where we're ending the day. I hope everyone had fun tonight. Um... Always. Jacob, your job thing. What's going on with that? Do you know yet? No.
