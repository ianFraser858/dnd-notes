## Session Summary

### Part 1: Looting the Beetle Riders
The session opened with Emily providing a recap of the previous session's events - beetle riders, city sensors, Ivan's concerning promises about not being eaten. The party looted the defeated ambushers.

**Loot Found:**
- 4 suits of studded leather
- 1 +1 maul (estimated 35 gold each, ~140 gold for 4)
- 1 short sword
- 1 lesser healing potion (2d8+5)
- 1 moderate glue bomb (taken by Zarius)
- 1 sling with 10 bullets
- 20 gold pieces

The party has a Type 1 Bag of Holding. They took a short rest on the carts and continued to Silverleaf.

### Part 2: Arrival in Silverleaf
The caravan arrived at Ivan's (Evan's) warehouse in Silverleaf. Zarius and Jack helped unload carts (Sierra supervised/backseat drove, Moz and Ardryl did not help). Unloading took about 4 minutes per cart.

**Payment Received:** 4 gold pieces each (2 initial + 2 upon completion)

Ivan offered future work caravanning back to Sledgehammer and lodging at 4 gold per night. The party declined for now.

### Part 3: Silverleaf Under Mind Flayer Control
As they exited the warehouse, passersby noticed them and hurried away nervously.

**World-Building - Silvermoor City-States:**
- Silverleaf
- Highgarden
- Goldvine
- Ivymont (fourth city-state)

### Part 4: Ardryl's Bounty
Walking around the building, Ardryl discovered a collection of wanted posters. His face was prominently displayed with the highest bounty: **50 gold pieces**.

**Backstory Revealed:**
- Governor Little (John Little) was formerly the corrupt mayor of Ardryl's hometown
- During the year gap after returning from the cognitive plane, Ardryl returned home with his grandfather
- John Little had turned everything corrupt; Ardryl overthrew him and kicked him out
- Little has since become Governor of Silverleaf and pledges fealty to the mind flayers
- The wanted poster shows Ardryl in his current gear, including items from the Seat of the Thunderlord

Ardryl hugged Ivan in public (hood down) to intentionally associate the smuggler with his wanted face - a petty act of revenge for Ivan's earlier behavior.

### Part 5: The Mysterious Pyramid
The party spotted a giant, shiny, light-blue pyramid in the distance - something that was NOT there a year ago when Ardryl last visited.

### Part 6: Zorab's Emporium
The party visited **Zorab's Emporium**, a small but well-stocked legitimate shop. They met **Cole**, a halfling shopkeeper.

**Key Information from Cole:**
Cole was legally required to hit a silent alarm when the party entered (they came through the "back way" via Ivan), but told them they had 5 minutes before guards arrived.

**Mind Flayer Takeover (2 weeks ago):**
- Mind flayers swept in and took control
- All government officials declared them the new rulers
- Governor Little pledged fealty to the squids
- They rule from their floating city above

**The Pyramid:**
- Dropped off about a month ago
- Governor Little promised it would bring "new jobs"
- Warlord Jurgen approved its placement
- Everyone who enters the pyramid does not come back out
- No rumors about what happens inside because no one returns to tell

**Curfew Rules:**
- Gates close at sundown
- Must be in homes by 10 PM
- Anyone caught breaking curfew is sent to work in the pyramid
- Sensors throughout the city monitor for violations

**Purchases:**
- Ardryl bought an elite disguise kit (40 gold) + free cosmetics refill
- Applied disguise before leaving (DC 21 to see through it)

The party exited left as instructed and watched the guards run past them into the shop, then out the right side.

### Part 7: The Tail
Jack noticed someone following the party - poorly hidden but good at blending into crowds. The follower didn't seem threatening but was obviously tailing them.

**Actions Taken:**
- Jack marked the tail as Hunted Prey
- Party climbed up a building to lose them (using mountaineering training for climb speeds)
- Successfully lost the tail with stealth checks
- Jack cast Hunter's Vision (10-minute duration) to light up the target if seen again

The party debated going to a tavern Ardryl knew (one that wasn't frequented by guards a year ago) but decided to follow the mysterious tail instead.
