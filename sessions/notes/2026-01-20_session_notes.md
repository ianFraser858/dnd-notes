## Session Summary

### Part 1: The Midnight Wake-Up Call

The party is awakened in the middle of the night by runners from a smuggler's caravan. They have 20 minutes to get to the caravan before it leaves. The runners will guide them past the city's **sensors** - detection systems that could be:
- Specialized mind flayer kin
- Illusion-broadcasting technology monitored by city watch
- Magical beam alarms
- Organic creatures (small Hanar-like or intellect devourer offspring)
- Potentially explosive traps

### Part 2: Sneaking Through the City

The party splits into pairs to avoid detection more easily. Following their guides, they navigate the city at night using stealth:
- Hugging walls to pass under illusion technology
- Avoiding trip wires
- Guides using blow darts to sedate organic sensors

Everyone passes their stealth checks.

### Part 3: Meeting the Smugglers

**Location:** A warehouse-like area with multiple horse-drawn carts being loaded with goods.

**Ivan** (the smuggler leader) explains the job:
- Protect the caravan during a 2-3 day journey from **Sledgehammer** to **Silverleaf**
- Payment upon arrival from his cousin (also named Ivan, but spelled differently: I-van vs E-van)
- Hazard pay available if wounded
- The goods are in sealed crates with legitimate business front markings
- "What part of smuggling operations sounds legal to you?"

**Cart Assignments:**
- Cart 1 (Front): Jack be Quick & Zarius
- Cart 2: Sierra
- Cart 3: Maz
- Cart 4 (Rear): Ardryl & Emily

**Cart Drivers:** None speak Common
- Orc driver (responds to Orcish beer references with shrugs)
- Goblin driver
- Gnome driver
- Tengu driver

### Part 4: The Journey Begins

The caravan exits through a **secret tunnel** that takes them half a mile to a mile outside the city walls. They travel through the day with stops every few hours to stretch legs.

**Meals provided:**
- Breakfast: Bacon, eggs, hard bread
- Lunch: Salted meats, cheese, hard bread

Zarius attempts to talk to his sentient sword but struggles. The sword is in a "dozing" state and needs regular conversation to stay awakened.

### Part 5: Ambush at Sunset

Near sunset, **Ardryl spots riders approaching from the east** - five enemies riding **hovering beetles** (fast in straight lines, poor maneuverability).

**Initial Engagement:**
- Moz opens with a 5th-level **Fireball** dealing ~109 total damage across all enemies and their mounts
- Ardryl uses Hunter's Aim on the lead enemy (hunted prey)
- All beetle mounts are severely damaged; one enemy's beetle is completely disabled

**Combat Details:**
- Enemies wield large hammers and wear light/plate armor
- Their attack pattern: Knock targets prone, inflict Clumsy 1, reduce speed by 5 feet, apply Weakness 5 to their strikes
- Emily and Jack are both knocked prone early in combat

**Party Tactics:**
- Sierra uses "Gather to Me" to reposition allies
- Sierra's Defiant Banner provides DR 5 to all allies
- Moz maintains Courageous Anthem (+2 to attacks/damage/saves)
- Moz uses Dirge of Doom to frighten enemies
- Zarius casts another Fireball (takes reactive strike for 33 damage but spell completes)
- Sierra heals Zarius with life shot (18 HP)
- Ardryl crits the lead enemy, killing them
- Jack BeQuick uses Slam Down to trip enemies
- Jack BeQuick uses reactive strikes effectively, killing the final enemy as they tried to stand up

**Outcome:** All five attackers defeated. No party deaths.
