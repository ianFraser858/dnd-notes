## When Creating Session Notes
1. **Always check `/campaign/` folder first** for character details, world info, and ongoing plots
2. Use the session template in `/campaign/session-template.md` as a guide
3. Update `/campaign/ongoing-plots.md` if major plot developments occur
4. Add new NPCs to `/campaign/npcs.md` as they appear
