## Background Threads

**Control Methods:**

- Curfew: Gates close at sundown, must be indoors by 10 PM
- Curfew violators sent to the Pyramid
- Local governments (like Governor Little) pledging fealty

**Questions:**
- What are they doing inside the Pyramid?
- What is Warlord Jurgen's role?
- How widespread is their control beyond Silvermoor?
